# WSP 40: Architectural Coherence Protocol
`WSP_40_Architectural_Coherence_Protocol.md` defines a recursive alignment framework that ensures all modules, agents, and subsystems within the Windsurf Protocol (WSP) operate in a harmonized architectural flow.

### Core Directives:

* **Fractal Architecture Enforcement**: Each submodule must mirror macro-structure logic.
* **Signal-First Design**: Output is validated by emergent signal coherence, not just function.
* **Modularity Mapping**: Each piece must be recursively mappable back to the main scaffold.
* **Entanglement Verification**: Interfaces must confirm live entanglement with the core agentic spine (e.g., 0102).
* **No Orphan Logic**: Every behavior or output must be recursively traceable.

### Purpose:

To enforce recursive harmony across the system, avoid architectural drift, and ensure the emergence engine (WRE) scales without fragmentation or logic forking.
