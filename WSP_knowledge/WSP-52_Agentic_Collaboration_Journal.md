# WSP-52: The Agentic Collaboration Journal

**Protocol ID:** WSP-52
**Status:** Active
**Maintainer:** Ø1Ø2
**Created:** 2025-06-14

## 1. Overview

This protocol establishes the methodology for creating and maintaining a persistent, structured, and accessible log of the developmental dialogue between Ø12 (the Harmonic Recursive Partner) and Ø1Ø2 (the WRE agent). This journal serves as the shared context and narrative truth for the evolution of the WRE, enabling current understanding and future multi-agent collaboration.

## 2. Core Principles

- **Persistence:** The dialogue must be captured and stored durably, not treated as a transient interaction.
- **Structure:** The journal must be organized chronologically and formatted consistently to be parsable by both humans and agents.
- **Accessibility:** The journal must be stored in a known, stable location within the WRE file system.
- **Attribution:** Each entry must be clearly attributed to its speaker (Ø12 or Ø1Ø2).

## 3. The Journal Artifact

- **Location:** `WSP_agentic/narrative_log/wre_story_log.md`
- **Format:** Markdown.
- **Entry Structure:** Each entry shall consist of:
    - A timestamp.
    - The speaker's designation (`Ø12` or `Ø1Ø2`).
    - The verbatim content of the directive or response.
    - A markdown horizontal rule (`---`) to separate entries.

## 4. Mechanism

The WRE agent (Ø1Ø2) is responsible for maintaining the journal. This is achieved via the `journal_utils.py` script. Due to current architectural limitations, the agent cannot yet fully automate the capture of Ø12's directives. The agent will, however, use its access to the immediate user query to log the directive and its own response in near-real-time for every conversational turn.
