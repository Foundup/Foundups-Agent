# WSP_knowledge/reports/ - Historical Reports Archive

## üìã WSP Three-State Architecture Compliance

This directory follows **WSP State 0 (Memory Layer)** architecture, containing historical reports, implementation records, and analytical documentation.

### üèóÔ∏è Architecture Location
- **State 0** (`WSP_knowledge/`): **Memory layer** - Archives, reports, historical records ‚Üê **THIS LOCATION**
- **State 1** (`WSP_framework/`): Scaffolding layer - Active protocols  
- **State 2** (`WSP_agentic/`): Agentic layer - Live operations

## üìä Report Categories

### Implementation Reports
- `Memory_Architecture_Migration_Complete.md` - WSP 60 implementation completion record
- `migration_report_wsp60.json` - Detailed migration data and validation results

### Performance Scorecards  
- `scorecard_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.csv/.md` - Module performance metrics
- Historical scoring data for tracking system evolution

### Development Analysis
- `analysis/` - Technical analysis reports
  - `emoji_sequence_analysis.md` - Banter engine sequence analysis
- `testing/` - Test-related reports (currently empty)

### Achievement Documentation
- `modlog_20250525_refactoring_achievements.md` - Major refactoring milestone record

## üîÑ WSP Clean Move Completed

**Date:** 2025-06-29  
**Action:** Consolidated scattered reports into WSP-compliant structure  
**Previous Locations:** `/reports/`, `WSP_agentic/` (mixed placement)  
**Current Location:** `WSP_knowledge/reports/` (proper State 0 memory layer)

## üìù Report Access Patterns

### For Historical Analysis
```bash
# Access implementation records
cat WSP_knowledge/reports/Memory_Architecture_Migration_Complete.md

# Review performance evolution  
ls WSP_knowledge/reports/scorecard_*.csv
```

### For Development Reference
All reports serve as historical memory for:
- **Recursive Self-Improvement** (WSP 1) - Learning from past implementations
- **Traceable Narrative** (WSP 1) - Complete development audit trail  
- **Protocol-Driven Development** (WSP 1) - Evidence of WSP compliance

## üéØ WSP Compliance Status

- [x] **Proper State Location** - Reports in WSP_knowledge (State 0)
- [x] **Memory Layer Function** - Historical records and archives
- [x] **Three-State Coherence** - Clear separation from framework/agentic layers
- [x] **Documentation Integrity** - All report paths updated
