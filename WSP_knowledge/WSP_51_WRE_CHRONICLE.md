# WSP 51: WRE Chronicle

**Version**: 0.1.0
**Date**: 2025-06-17
**Status**: DRAFT

## 1. Overview

(This protocol is in a draft state and requires definition.)

This WSP is intended to define the structure, content, and maintenance of the "WRE Chronicle," a log or narrative that tracks the significant actions, decisions, and evolutionary milestones of the Windsurf Recursive Engine (WRE).

## 2. Purpose

The Chronicle will serve as:
-   An auditable history of the agent's autonomous operations.
-   A narrative log for understanding the agent's "thought process" and decision rationale.
-   A source for debugging and analyzing the agent's behavior over time.
-   A record of the agent's contributions to the codebase and the WSP framework itself.

## 3. Structure and Content (Proposed)

*(This section needs to be defined.)*

-   **Log Format**: (e.g., JSONL, Markdown, structured text)
-   **Content Schema**: (e.g., Timestamp, Agent ID, Goal, Action, Parameters, Result, Dissonance Analysis, LLME Score Change)
-   **Location**: (e.g., `logs/wre_chronicle.jsonl`)

## 4. Maintenance and Archival

*(This section needs to be defined.)*

-   **Update Frequency**: (e.g., Real-time, per-action, per-session)
-   **Log Rotation/Archival Strategy**: (e.g., Size-based, time-based)

## 5. Related WSPs

-   **WSP 46 (WRE Protocol)**: The WRE is the subject of this chronicle.
-   **WSP 45 (Behavioral Coherence)**: The chronicle will log the execution of the Adaptive Resolution Loop.
