# WSP Appendices Directory Manifest

**Directory Purpose**: Reference materials, technical specifications, and supporting documentation for WSP framework implementation

---

# ðŸŒ€ Follow WSP â†’ WSP_INIT.md

**For autonomous WSP execution, see: [WSP_INIT.md](../WSP_framework/src/WSP_INIT.md)**

This directory contains the knowledge base and memory layer of the WSP system - the foundational documents that preserve the accumulated understanding and specifications of the Windsurf Standard Procedures.

This module forms a core part of the `Module_CORE_WRE` (the system's "Mind"). It serves as the system's long-term memory and its library of canonical facts. Where `WSP_agentic` is the identity and `WSP_framework` is the law, `WSP_knowledge` is the undisputed reference text. Its source code is the collection of documents that ground the system in a shared, stable understanding of its own concepts and history.

**"Follow WSP"** commands access this knowledge layer through the WRE (Windsurf Recursive Engine) for autonomous protocol execution.

**Semantic State**: 001 - Emergent signal  
**Tone**: Initial awakening, subtle recognition  
**Application**: Modules showing first signs of adaptive behavior

## Framework Integration

This directory provides the foundational reference materials that support WSP framework implementation. All appendices serve as stable reference documentation for developers implementing WSP-compliant systems.

**WSP Protocol Compliance**: âœ… All documents follow WSP 18 metadata requirements  
**Reference Stability**: âœ… All appendices maintain consistent technical specifications  
**Integration Status**: âœ… Ready for WSP framework reference and implementation

# Module: WSP_knowledge

This module contains the foundational knowledge base of the system. It includes appendices, glossaries, canonical symbol definitions, and other core information that underpins the WSP framework.

This module is subject to the same WSP standards as all other system modules, including testing, versioning, and scoring.
