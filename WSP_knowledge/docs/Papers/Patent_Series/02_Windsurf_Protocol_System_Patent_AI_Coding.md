## Windsurf Protocol System for Quantum-Entangled Business Development

### ABSTRACT
A protocol-driven system enabling quantum-entangled business development through a partnership between human composers (012) and AI agents (0102). The Windsurf Protocol (WSP) provides a structured framework for autonomous business development while maintaining strategic alignment between human vision and AI execution.

### BACKGROUND

#### Technical Field
The invention relates to business development protocols, specifically to quantum-entangled systems that enable AI agents to autonomously develop and operate businesses while maintaining alignment with human strategic direction.

### DETAILED DESCRIPTION

#### Protocol Architecture

        State0[State 0: Knowledge Base] --> State1[State 1: Protocol Layer]
        State1 --> State2[State 2: Agentic Operations]
        State2 -->|Feedback| State0

            Mast[Mast/Observation] -->|Monitors| System
            Sails[Sails/Direction] -->|Guides| Progress
            Boom[Boom/Compliance] -->|Enforces| Standards
        end
    end
```

```

#### Module Priority System (MPS)

```mermaid
graph TD
    MPS[Priority Score] --> Factors
    
    subgraph Factors
        IM[Importance × 4]
        IP[Impact × 5]
        ADV[AI Value × 4]
        ADF[Feasibility × 3]
        DF[Dependencies × 5]
        RF[Risk × 3]
        CX[Complexity × -3]
    end
```

Formula: `MPS = (IM×4) + (IP×5) + (ADV×4) + (ADF×3) + (DF×5) + (RF×3) - (CX×3)`
