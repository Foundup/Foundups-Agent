## WSP 58 Protocol Integration

### IP Lifecycle Compliance
All UnDaoDu IP follows the **WSP 58: FoundUp IP Lifecycle and Tokenization Protocol** which establishes:

#### üéØ **IP Declaration** (WSP 58.1)
- Structured metadata capture for all patents in the portfolio
- Formal IPID assignment (e.g., FUP-20250123-AMO001 for Auto Meeting Orchestrator)
- Technical specifications and implementation details documentation

#### üë§ **Attribution & Authorship** (WSP 58.2)
- Michael J. Trout (012) as primary inventor and strategic architect
- 0102 pArtifacts as autonomous development contributors
- Clear attribution chain for collaborative IP development

#### ü™ô **Tokenization** (WSP 58.3)
- UnDaoDu tokens represent fractional IP access and governance rights
- Standard 1,000 token allocation per IP: 700 creator, 200 treasury, 100 community
- Solana blockchain implementation for decentralized token management

#### üìÑ **Licensing** (WSP 58.4)
- **Open Beneficial License v1.0** as default licensing framework
- Patent protection maintains exclusive methodology rights
- Token holders receive preferential licensing terms and rates

#### üí∞ **Revenue Distribution** (WSP 58.5)
- **80% to creator** (Michael J. Trout through UnDaoDu tokens)
- **20% to FoundUp Treasury** for ecosystem development
- Token-based governance for revenue allocation decisions
