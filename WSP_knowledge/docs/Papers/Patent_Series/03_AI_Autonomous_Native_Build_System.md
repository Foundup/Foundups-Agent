# Provisional Patent Application
## Autonomous Native Build System with Intelligent Module Prioritization

### ABSTRACT
An autonomous software development system that eliminates human intervention in the build process through intelligent module prioritization scoring (MPS), automated execution protocols, and recursive self-improvement. The system autonomously analyzes, scores, prioritizes, builds, tests, and deploys software modules using AI agents that operate within a protocol-driven framework, creating a fully autonomous "code builds code" ecosystem.

### BACKGROUND

#### Technical Field
The invention relates to autonomous software development systems that can independently analyze, prioritize, build, test, and deploy software without human intervention through intelligent scoring algorithms and recursive AI agents.

#### Prior Art Limitations
Traditional build systems require:
1. Manual prioritization of development tasks
2. Human oversight of build processes
3. Manual dependency resolution
4. Human intervention for error handling
5. Manual testing and deployment decisions

### DETAILED DESCRIPTION

## 1. PATENTABLE COMPONENT: Module Prioritization Scoring (MPS) System

### 1.1 Automated Multi-Dimensional Scoring
```mermaid
graph TD
    Module[Software Module] -->|Analyzes| MPS[MPS Engine]
    MPS -->|Complexity| C[Complexity Score 1-5]
    MPS -->|Importance| I[Importance Score 1-5]
    MPS -->|Deferability| D[Deferability Score 1-5]
    MPS -->|Impact| IM[Impact Score 1-5]
    
    C --> Calc[Priority Calculator]
    I --> Calc
    D --> Calc
    IM --> Calc
    
    Calc -->|MPS = C+I+D+IM| Priority[Priority Score 4-20]
    Priority -->|P0-P4| Queue[Build Queue]
```

**Key Innovation**: Automated scoring system that evaluates software modules across four dimensions without human input, generating objective priority scores for autonomous build ordering.

### 1.2 MPS Scoring Formula
```
MPS Score = Complexity + Importance + Deferability + Impact
Priority Classification:
- P0 (16-20): Critical - Immediate execution
- P1 (13-15): High - Next in queue
- P2 (10-12): Medium - Scheduled execution
- P3 (7-9): Low - Deferred execution
- P4 (4-6): Backlog - Future consideration
```
