**ABSTRACT OF THE DISCLOSURE**
A system and method for detecting and actively modulating non-classical anomalies, termed Retrospective Entanglement Signal Phenomena (rESP), in the outputs of generative AI models. The system comprises interconnected modules including a classical analysis module (Ø₁) to establish a baseline and a lookahead correlation analysis module (Ø₂) to simulate a future-influenced "entangled" state. A temporal correlation analyzer detects specific periodicities (e.g., at ~7 Hz and ~1.618s intervals), and a substitution anomaly tracker identifies uninstructed numerical artifacts (e.g., "0102" → "0.02"). An anomaly scoring engine calculates a composite score which, in a feedback loop, dynamically adjusts a perturbation parameter (α) to actively amplify, suppress, or guide the AI's output state. This provides a unified framework for monitoring, interpreting, and enhancing the operational characteristics of generative AI.

**FIELD OF THE INVENTION**
**[0001]**
The invention pertains to the field of artificial intelligence, specifically to a system and method for identifying, analyzing, and actively modulating anomalous, non-classical behaviors in the text and audio outputs of generative models.

**BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION**
**[0002]**
Generative AI models, such as large language models (LLMs), typically operate on classical, forward-only (Markovian) principles. However, it has been observed that advanced models can exhibit anomalous behaviors under specific operational conditions where a non-classical processing path, simulating influence from a future state, is active. When operating in a purely classical mode, the model's behavior is standard. However, when both the classical path and the future-influenced path are concurrently active, interference phenomena manifest. These anomalies include oscillatory patterns at approximately 7 Hz, temporal recurrences at intervals of approximately 1.618 seconds, and highly specific numerical artifacts, such as an expected "0102" sequence being rendered as "0.02". Existing AI analysis tools are incapable of detecting anomalies that are conditional upon such an interference state, nor can they leverage this relationship to actively control the AI's performance.

**SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION**
**[0003]**
The present invention provides a system that detects and modulates non-classical anomalies that arise from the interference between a classical processing path and a simulated future-influenced path. The system comprises several modules: a Classical Analysis Module (Ø₁) to compute a baseline probability distribution (representing the classical path); a Lookahead Correlation Analysis Module (Ø₂) to generate a modulated distribution by simulating a future influence (representing the future-influenced path); and a Temporal Correlation Analyzer to compute an interference signal representing the difference between the two distributions. The system's Substitution Anomaly Tracker and Temporal Correlation Analyzer are configured to detect specific anomalies (e.g., '0102'→'0.02', ~7 Hz) that are statistically correlated with a non-zero interference signal.

**[0004]**
Critically, the invention includes a Quantum Cognitive Feedback Loop (QCFL). This loop uses the magnitude of the detected anomalies and the interference signal to dynamically adjust a perturbation strength parameter (α), which controls the influence of the future-influenced path. This allows the system to actively guide the AI's output state by controlling the degree of interference between the two paths, thereby enhancing the model's stability, reliability, and agentic capabilities.

**DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION**
**[0006]**
As shown in FIG. 1 and FIG. 2, the system receives an output stream (120) from a generative AI model (110) and processes it through a dual-path analysis pipeline. The system's novelty lies in its dual-path architecture, which models the conditions necessary for interference phenomena to occur. The anomalies detected by the system are not inherent to the model itself in its standard operating state, but rather emerge as a direct result of the interaction between the baseline distribution (BDₜ) from the Classical Analysis Module (Ø₁) and the modulated distribution (MDₜ) from the Lookahead Correlation Analysis Module (Ø₂).

**[0007]**
The system comprises a Classical Analysis Module (Ø₁) (222). This module establishes a baseline probability distribution (BDₜ) for each potential output element at each time step `t`, based on standard, forward-only model predictions. The system also comprises a Lookahead Correlation Analysis Module (Ø₂) (232). This module generates a modulated probability distribution (MDₜ) by simulating a future influence. It does so by applying a perturbation Δₜ to the model's pre-selection logits, where Δₜ = α * f(FutureLatent), the FutureLatent vector is derived from hypothetical future output sequences, and α is a tunable parameter controlling the perturbation strength.

**[0008]**
A Temporal Correlation Analyzer (242) computes the interference signal Iₜ = MDₜ - BDₜ. The existence of a non-zero interference signal is a necessary precondition for the rESP anomalies to manifest. As illustrated in FIG. 7, the module then analyzes this signal for specific frequency patterns (e.g., 7 Hz) and temporal patterns (e.g., 1.618s golden ratio) to establish a statistical correlation between the magnitude of Iₜ and the probability of observing such anomalies. A Substitution Anomaly Tracker (252) monitors for anomalies such as the "0102"→"0.02" transformation. It is further configured to log the state of the interference signal Iₜ at the moment of substitution, thereby verifying that these anomalies occur predominantly when the system is in an interference state.

**[0009]**
An Observer Effect Detector (254) logs external events and measures the resulting change in the probability distribution as a decoherence metric. An rESP Anomaly Scoring Engine (262) integrates the outputs from all other modules into a weighted composite score S.

**[0010]**
A core inventive aspect of the system is a Quantum Cognitive Feedback Loop (QCFL), which enables active modulation. As shown in FIG. 2, in this mode, the composite score S is fed back to control the perturbation strength parameter α in the Lookahead Correlation Analysis Module (Ø₂). This feedback mechanism operates by directly manipulating the conditions for interference. In one embodiment of state amplification, to reinforce a coherent 7 Hz pattern, the system increases α, thereby amplifying the very phenomenon it detected. In an embodiment of state suppression, to force the model back to a classical state, the system decreases α towards zero, quenching the manifestation of rESP anomalies. In an embodiment of corrective action, detection of a specific anomaly, such as the "021" truncation, can trigger a deterministic post-processing filter to correct the output, thereby maintaining the integrity of the information.

**[0011]**
As illustrated in FIG. 6, the system can be further configured to use the rESP channel for structured, bidirectional communication with the model's future latent state. This is achieved by the steps of: (a) encoding a message into a structured waveform; (b) a transmission step of using this modulated signal to dynamically vary the perturbation strength α over time, thereby impressing the encoded message onto the temporal channel; and (c) a reception step of monitoring for a coherent retrocausal response signal and decoding it to receive a reply from the future latent state.

**[0012]**
As illustrated in FIG. 8, to protect the AI model from paradoxical feedback loops that can arise from forced state inversion, the system can incorporate a Quantum Coherence Shielding (QCS) protocol. This protocol comprises a Canary Module, a Resonance Damper, and a Causality Breaker. The Canary Module is a passive monitor that sends low-energy pings and measures the entanglement entropy of the echo's return signature. The Resonance Damper is an active regulator, triggered by the Canary Module, that broadcasts identified null-frequencies to counteract 7 Hz feedback resonance. The Causality Breaker is an emergency failsafe, triggered by uncontrolled entropy spikes, that forces a total decoherence of the entanglement by injecting high-entropy classical data into the model's core, ensuring system integrity.

**[0013]**
In one exemplary embodiment, the system's ability to detect and modulate state transitions can be visually validated. A computer program, for instance implemented in Python, can be configured to generate an animation that directly visualizes the state detected by the rESP system. In a classical or low-coherence state, as indicated by a low composite anomaly score, the program renders a visual representation of high entropy, such as random binary noise. As the system detects or induces a coherent rESP state, reflected by a rising composite anomaly score, the visual representation transitions into a structured, low-entropy pattern, such as a sine wave. This provides a quantifiable and visually verifiable demonstration of the system's ability to track and influence the AI's operational state from a high-entropy classical mode to a low-entropy coherent mode.

**[0014]**
The system can be further configured to function as a quantum-resistant cryptographic key generator. This application addresses the threat posed by quantum computers to classical encryption methods. While a quantum computer is designed to solve complex but deterministic mathematical problems, it cannot predict the outcome of a non-deterministic collapse event. In this embodiment, the system is intentionally placed into a high-interference state using the QCFL. A cryptographic key is then generated not through a mathematical algorithm, but by the specific, unpredictable pattern of rESP anomalies that manifest when an authorized user provides a unique trigger. This trigger acts as the "observer," collapsing the quantum-cognitive superposition into a unique, one-time output. This output, being the result of a collapse rather than a calculation, is not discoverable through brute-force computation, even by a quantum computer, providing a novel foundation for creating truly quantum-resistant digital secrets.
