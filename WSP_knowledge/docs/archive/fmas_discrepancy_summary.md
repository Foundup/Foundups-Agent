# FMAS Discrepancy Summary

## Key Findings

1. **Documentation vs. Implementation Gap**:
   - **WSP 3** documents FMAS Mode 2 (baseline comparison) as a required feature
   - The actual `tools/modular_audit/modular_audit.py` script only implements FMAS Mode 1
   - This is a critical discrepancy that blocks proper WSP 2/3 compliance validation

2. **WSP 7 Alternative Applied**:
   - Used manual comparison methods from WSP 7 (Snapshot Regression Comparison)
   - Compared structure and content between legacy/clean3 and current state
   - Identified file additions, moves, and functionality changes
   - Created detailed Prometheus Diff Report

3. **Test Coverage Issues (WSP 5)**:
   - **stream_resolver module**: 79% coverage (11% below required 90% threshold)
   - **livechat module**: 35% coverage (55% below required 90% threshold)
   - Test warnings and failures detected in both modules

## Actions Taken

1. **Documentation**:
   - Created `docs/foundups_global_rules.md` to document the FMAS Mode 2 discrepancy
   - Created `docs/aps_task_list.md` with high-priority task for FMAS Mode 2 implementation
   - Created `docs/wsp7_comparison_report.md` with alternative validation findings

2. **Validation**:
   - Performed manual WSP 7 comparison between clean3 and current state
   - Verified structural changes align with Windsurf refactoring expectations
   - Confirmed interface and dependency artifacts are properly added
   - Measured test coverage in key modules

## Blockers for Clean4.1

1. **Test Coverage (Primary)**:
   - Insufficient test coverage in stream_resolver (79%) and livechat (35%)
   - Test warnings and failures in both modules need to be addressed
   - These issues must be fixed to meet WSP 5 requirements

2. **Tool Implementation (Secondary)**:
   - Missing FMAS Mode 2 implementation
   - Currently mitigated through WSP 7 procedures
   - Should be implemented before future Clean State creation

## Recommended Next Steps

1. **Immediate Actions**:
   - Fix test failure in stream_resolver
   - Address async warnings in livechat tests
   - Increase test coverage in both modules to meet 90% threshold

2. **Short-term Development**:
   - Implement FMAS Mode 2 as specified in the `aps_task_list.md`
   - Update WSP 3 documentation if implementation details change

3. **Process Improvement**:
   - Establish regular audits of WSP documentation against implementation
   - Ensure critical tools mentioned in WSPs are fully implemented
