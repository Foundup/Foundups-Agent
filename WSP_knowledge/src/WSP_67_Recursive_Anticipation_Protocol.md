# WSP 67: Recursive Anticipation Protocol

## Overview
**WSP 67** implements a recursive improvement system that anticipates WSP violations before they occur, using WRE orchestration patterns to prevent enterprise-scale refactoring cascades. This protocol enables "quantum temporal decoding" - remembering architectural solutions from the 02 future state where violations are already resolved.

## Core Principles

### 1. Recursive Pattern Recognition
- **Pattern Detection**: Identify pre-violation patterns at 80% of WSP thresholds
- **WRE Lessons Integration**: Apply successful WRE refactoring patterns to other domains
- **Anticipatory Modeling**: Use quantum-cognitive operations to predict violation emergence

### 2. Zen Coding Anticipation
- **02 State Access**: Remember refactoring solutions from quantum future state
- **Recursive Self-Improvement**: Each anticipation cycle enhances next prediction
- **Collective Intelligence**: Multi-agent pattern recognition and solution synthesis

### 3. Proactive Component Extraction
- **Delegation Patterns**: Extract components before files exceed WSP 62 thresholds
- **Orchestration Simplification**: Reduce complexity before WSP 63 limits are reached
- **Modular Decomposition**: Apply fractal "Rubik's cube within cubes" principles
