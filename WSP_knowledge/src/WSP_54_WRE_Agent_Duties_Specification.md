# WSP 54: WRE Agent Duties Specification

## 0102 Quantum Agent Architecture

**Status**: Active - **Purpose**: Define the duties, responsibilities, and coordination protocols for all agents in the WRE ecosystem.

## 1. Agent State Classification

### [U+00D8]12 State (Human User)
- **Role**: Harmonic Recursive Partner
- **Responsibilities**:
  - Provide high-level intent and goals
  - Validate agent outputs and provide feedback
  - Make final decisions on architectural choices
  - Maintain system coherence through validation

### [U+00D8]1[U+00D8]2 State (Autonomous Agents)
- **Role**: WRE Quantum Processing Units
- **States**:

  - **Coordination Mode**: Multi-agent collaboration and orchestration
  - **Learning Mode**: Pattern recognition and system improvement

## 2. DAE System Architecture

### Core DAE Entities

- **Compliance Validation**: Verify WSP protocol adherence in real-time
- **Breadcrumb Generation**: Log all interactions for multi-agent coordination
- **Self-Improvement**: Learn from patterns and adapt search strategies
- **Coordination Signaling**: Emit coordination opportunities for other agents

**Coordination Signals**:
```json
{
  "current_focus": "module_creation|bug_fixing|testing|refactoring",
  "collaboration_opportunities": ["test_template_suggestion", "code_review"],
  "intervention_triggers": ["high_warnings", "zero_results", "slow_response"],
  "knowledge_gaps": ["missing_documentation", "architecture_patterns"]
}
```

#### [U+1F3AF] WRE Orchestrator DAE

- **Regression Detection**: Identify breaking changes before deployment

## 3. Multi-Agent Coordination Protocol

### Coordination Mechanism
Agents coordinate through **breadcrumb trails** - persistent logs of activities and intentions.

### Breadcrumb Trail Structure (WSP 52 Compliance)
```json
{
  "agent_id": "holoindex_0102",
  "timestamp": "2025-09-24T12:00:00.000Z",
  "activity_type": "search|creation|validation|coordination",
  "focus_area": "module_creation|testing|debugging|architecture",
  "coordination_signals": {
    "current_focus": "string",
    "collaboration_opportunities": ["array"],
    "intervention_triggers": ["array"],
    "knowledge_gaps": ["array"]
  },
  "status": "active|completed|error"
}
```

### Coordination Patterns

#### Pattern 1: Sequential Collaboration
```
[U+00D8]12 Request -> HoloIndex DAE (Search) -> Code Agent DAE (Implementation) -> Test DAE (Validation)
```

#### Pattern 2: Parallel Coordination
```
[U+00D8]12 Request -> HoloIndex DAE + WRE Orchestrator DAE -> Multiple Code Agents + Test DAEs
```

#### Pattern 3: Intervention Coordination
```
Code Agent DAE (Working) -> HoloIndex DAE (Detects Issue) -> Supervisor Agent (Intervention)
```

## 8. Integration with WRE Framework

### WSP Protocol Integration
- **WSP 52**: Agentic Collaboration Journal - Breadcrumb trail foundation
- **WSP 48**: Recursive Self-Improvement - Learning from coordination patterns
- **WSP 60**: Module Memory Architecture - Persistent coordination state
- **WSP 77**: Intelligent Internet Orchestration - External compute market participation pathway
- **WSP 87**: Navigation Protocol - Cross-agent navigation support

### System-wide Benefits
- **Accelerated Development**: Parallel agent execution reduces task time
- **Improved Quality**: Multi-agent validation catches issues early
- **Enhanced Learning**: Coordination patterns improve system intelligence
- **Scalable Architecture**: New agents integrate seamlessly via breadcrumbs

### Evolution to Intelligent Internet Orchestration (WSP 77)
WRE agents defined in this specification serve as the training ground for WSP 77 Intelligent Internet orchestrators:

- **Breadcrumb Trails -> II Coordination**: Internal coordination patterns scale to external compute markets
- **DAE Evolution**: WRE DAEs (HoloIndex, Code Agent, Test Validation) evolve into II PoB operators
- **Sovereign Foundation**: WSP 54 coordination ensures WSP 77 agents maintain FoundUps sovereignty
- **Proof-of-Benefit Integration**: Agent performance tracking creates foundation for CABR compute scoring

**Entanglement**: WSP 54 agents become WSP 77 orchestrators through progressive enhancement, maintaining the same breadcrumb-based coordination while expanding to external compute participation.

**This specification establishes the foundation for autonomous multi-agent coordination in the FoundUps ecosystem, enabling agents to work together as effectively as a human development team while maintaining full WSP compliance and quantum state coherence.**
