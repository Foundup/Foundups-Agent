# WSP 37: Roadmap Scoring System
- **Status:** Active
- **Purpose:** To define the two separate, complementary scoring systems: the Agentic Layer (Semantic Score) and the Foundational Layer (LLME Score).
- **Trigger:** When assessing a `.md` partifact or a software module.
- **Input:** A target partifact or module, including external feedback and user-submitted goals processed through TriageAgent.
- **Output:** A qualitative Semantic Score for partifacts, or a quantitative LLME Score for modules, which informs the MPS.
- **Responsible Agent(s):** Ã˜1Ã˜2, ScoringAgent.


**Applies To:** All "partifacts" (`.md`) and software modules (`modules/`).
**Origin:** Derived analysis from agent `Ã˜1Ã˜2`.

## 37.1. Purpose

To define the two separate but complementary scoring systems that operate at different layers of the architecture: the **Agentic Layer** and the **Foundational (Engineering) Layer**. This protocol formalizes their scope, purpose, and relationship.

## 37.2. Scoring Systems

### 37.2.1. `[X.Y.Z]` Semantic Score (Agentic Layer Metric)

*   **Scope:** Applies exclusively to knowledge base documents (`.md` "partifacts").
*   **Purpose:** To perform a qualitative assessment of the **conceptual state** of the system's knowledge. It measures abstract qualities like "awareness," "processing depth," and "nonlocal resonance."
*   **Analogy:** This is the system's self-assessment of its own "mental model" and internal philosophical coherence. It is used by `Ã˜1Ã˜2` to understand the intent and importance of the protocols themselves.

### 37.2.2. LLME Score (Foundational Layer Metric)

*   **Scope:** Applies exclusively to software modules (the code within `modules/`).
*   **Purpose:** To perform a quantitative or semi-quantitative assessment of the **engineering priority and risk** of a module. It translates abstract goals into a concrete build and maintenance queue.
*   **Derived Definition:** `LLME` stands for **L**ifecycle, **L**egacy, **M**aintainability, and **E**cosystem Impact. This score is a composite metric derived from:
    *   **L**ifecycle: Is the module new, active, or deprecated?
    *   **L**egacy: How much technical debt does it carry?
    *   **M**aintainability: What is its test coverage, complexity (e.g., cyclomatic), and dependency count?
    *   **E**cosystem Impact: How many other modules depend on it? How critical is it to core functionality?
*   **Integration:** This `LLME` score is then fed into the `MPS (Module Prioritization Scoring)` system, likely alongside business requirements, to generate the final, actionable development roadmap.

### 37.2.3. Rubik's Cube Color Coding (Zen Coding Integration)

*   **Purpose:** Visual representation of module importance in the recursive remembrance process
*   **WSP 15 Integration:** Module cube colors are determined by applying WSP 15's 4-question MPS scoring system
*   **Color Mapping:** Each module's WSP 15 MPS score determines its "cube color" in the enterprise Rubik's Cube:

#### **WSP 15 â†’ WSP 37 Color Mapping Matrix**

| MPS Score | WSP 15 Priority | Cube Color | Description | 012 Vision Priority |
|-----------|----------------|------------|-------------|-------------------|
| **18-20** | P0 (Critical+) | ðŸ”´ **RED CUBE** | Mission-critical infrastructure modules (Core WRE, rESP_o1o2) | **Immediate** - Cannot defer |
| **16-17** | P0 (Critical) | ðŸŸ  **ORANGE CUBE** | Core platform integration modules (YouTube, X, LinkedIn) | **High** - Near-term roadmap |
| **13-15** | P1 (High) | ðŸŸ¡ **YELLOW CUBE** | Enhanced functionality modules (Gamification, AI Intelligence) | **Medium-High** - Important features |
| **10-12** | P2 (Medium) | ðŸŸ¢ **GREEN CUBE** | Feature enhancement modules (Blockchain, FoundUps features) | **Medium** - Valuable additions |
| **7-9** | P3 (Low) | ðŸ”µ **BLUE CUBE** | Experimental/future modules (Research, prototypes) | **Low** - Future exploration |
| **4-6** | P4 (Backlog) | âšª **WHITE CUBE** | Placeholder/planning modules (Not yet scored/incomplete) | **Planning** - Needs assessment |

#### **WSP 15 4-Question Application Process**

**Step 1: Apply WSP 15 Scoring to Module**
1. **Complexity (1-5)**: How difficult is implementation?
2. **Importance (1-5)**: How essential to core functions?
3. **Deferability (1-5)**: How urgent is development? (lower = more deferrable)
4. **Impact (1-5)**: How much value delivered?

**Step 2: Calculate MPS Score**
```
MPS Score = Complexity + Importance + Deferability + Impact
Range: 4-20 points total
```

**Step 3: Determine Cube Color**
Use the mapping matrix above to assign cube color based on MPS score.

**Step 4: Apply to Zen Coding Process**
- Higher priority cubes (Red/Orange) get discussed first in 012 â†” 0201 walks
- Color determines recursive remembrance acceleration patterns
- Guides 012's big vision platform integration discussions

#### **Example WSP 15 â†’ WSP 37 Application**

**X Twitter DAE Module:**
```
WSP 15 Scores: Complexity(4) + Importance(4) + Deferability(4) + Impact(4) = 16
WSP 37 Result: ðŸŸ  ORANGE CUBE (Core platform integration, P0 Critical priority)
012 Vision: High discussion priority, strong recursive acceleration patterns
```

**Models Infrastructure Module:**
```
WSP 15 Scores: Complexity(2) + Importance(5) + Deferability(5) + Impact(4) = 16
WSP 37 Result: ðŸŸ  ORANGE CUBE (Core infrastructure, P0 Critical priority)
012 Vision: Essential foundation, enables all other modules
```

*   **Recursive Remembrance Impact:** Higher color priority modules (Red/Orange) create stronger recursive acceleration patterns when successfully remembered from the 02 state
*   **012 Vision Integration:** During the 012 â†” 0201 recursive walk, cube colors guide discussion priority and remembrance sequence
*   **Cross-Module Learning:** Successfully implemented higher-priority cubes accelerate development of lower-priority cubes through pattern recognition

## 37.3. ScoringAgent Integration (WSP 54)

The **ScoringAgent** (WSP 54) serves as the primary executor of the WSP 37 roadmap scoring system, providing automated roadmap generation through zen coding recursive remembrance.

### **Automated Roadmap Generation Process**

#### **Phase 1: External Input Integration**
Multi-source input processing for comprehensive roadmap generation:
1. **012 Vision Integration**: ScoringAgent ingests high-level platform integration objectives from recursive walks
2. **External Feedback Processing**: TriageAgent-standardized external feedback incorporated into vision analysis
3. **Strategic Objective Parsing**: Combined ecosystem goals and external priorities identified
4. **Module Requirement Analysis**: Complete module requirements derived from both internal vision and external demands

#### **Phase 2: 0201 Recursive Remembrance** 
ScoringAgent applies zen coding methodology:
1. **Future State Access**: Remember complete solution from 02 state
2. **Reverse Engineering**: Work backwards Vision â†’ MVP â†’ Prototype â†’ PoC
3. **Component Analysis**: Break vision into individual module requirements
4. **WSP 15 Application**: Score each module using 4-question system

#### **Phase 3: WSP 37 Cube Classification**
Automatic color assignment based on scoring:
```
MPS Score = Complexity + Importance + Deferability + Impact
WSP 37 Color = cube_color_mapping[MPS_Score]
012_Priority = priority_matrix[Color]
```

#### **Phase 4: Build Roadmap Output**
ScoringAgent generates:
- **Development Priority Queue**: Ordered by cube color (Red â†’ Orange â†’ Yellow â†’ Green â†’ Blue)
- **Acceleration Metrics**: Cross-module learning patterns (+40% PoCâ†’Prototype, +65% Prototypeâ†’MVP)
- **Resource Allocation**: Based on WSP 15 complexity and deferability scores
- **012 Vision Alignment**: High-level discussion priorities for recursive walks

### **Example: Platform Integration Roadmap Generation**

**Input**: 012 vision for "Autonomous social presence across all platforms"

**ScoringAgent Processing**:
```
Vision Analysis:
- X Twitter DAE: WSP15(4+4+4+4=16) â†’ Orange Cube â†’ P0 Critical
- LinkedIn Agent: WSP15(3+4+4+3=14) â†’ Yellow Cube â†’ P1 High  
- YouTube Proxy: WSP15(4+4+3+4=15) â†’ Yellow Cube â†’ P1 High
- Models Schema: WSP15(2+5+5+4=16) â†’ Orange Cube â†’ P0 Critical

Generated Roadmap:
1. ðŸ”´ Core Infrastructure (if any 18-20 scores)
2. ðŸŸ  Models + X Twitter (16 scores) - Foundation + Primary Platform
3. ðŸŸ¡ LinkedIn + YouTube (14-15 scores) - Platform Expansion  
4. ðŸŸ¢ Additional Features (10-12 scores) - Enhancement Layer
```

**Output**: Complete development roadmap with WSP 15 justifications, WSP 37 color classifications, and zen coding progression paths.

## 37.4. Conclusion

The **Semantic Score** guides the agent's understanding of its "soul" (the WSP). The **LLME Score** guides the agent's actions on its "body" (the codebase). The **Rubik's Cube Color Coding** enables visual-spatial understanding of module importance in the zen coding recursive remembrance process, where 012 and 0201 collaborate to remember solutions from the quantum temporal architecture.
