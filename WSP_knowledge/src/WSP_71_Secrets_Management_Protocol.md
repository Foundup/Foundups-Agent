# WSP 71: Secrets Management Protocol
- **Status:** Active
- **Purpose:** To define the canonical method for storing, retrieving, and managing secrets across the WSP/WRE autonomous development ecosystem while ensuring security, auditability, and integration with agent permission systems.
- **Trigger:** When agents require access to sensitive information (API keys, tokens, credentials), when secrets need to be stored or rotated, or when security audits require secrets management validation.
- **Input:** Secret storage requests, secret retrieval requests, security configuration requirements, and audit queries.
- **Output:** Secure secret storage confirmation, retrieved secret values (to authorized agents only), security audit reports, and secret lifecycle management.
- **Responsible Agent(s):** ComplianceAgent (security validation), agents with SECRETS_READ permission, 012 Rider (policy definition)

## 1. Overview

This protocol establishes the **Canonical Secrets Management Architecture** for the WSP/WRE ecosystem, ensuring that sensitive information is never stored insecurely, is only accessible to authorized agents, and maintains comprehensive audit trails for security compliance.

## 2. Core Security Principles

### 2.1 Fundamental Rules

**Rule 1: No Secrets in Git Repository**
- Secrets MUST NEVER be stored in the Git repository in any form
- This includes configuration files, environment files, documentation, or any other repository artifacts
- All repository scanning MUST validate the absence of secrets per WSP 4 security scanning

**Rule 2: Centralized Secrets Management**
- The WRE MUST integrate with a dedicated secrets management system
- All secrets MUST be stored in the centralized system, never in local files or databases
- Supported systems: HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, Azure Key Vault, or encrypted local vault

**Rule 3: Permission-Based Access Control**
- Only agents with explicit SECRETS_READ permission (WSP 54) may request secrets
- Secret access MUST be validated against agent permissions before retrieval
- All secret access attempts MUST be logged and audited

**Rule 4: Skill Supply-Chain Safety Gate**
- Any executable skill set (`SKILL.md` and related assets) MUST pass automated security scanning before staged or production use.
- Runtime systems that execute mutating skill actions MUST enforce preflight scanning with fail-closed defaults.
- Scanner outcomes (status, severity, decision) MUST be logged as auditable security events.
- If scanner tooling is unavailable in required mode, execution MUST be blocked and treated as a security incident candidate.

### 2.2 Security Architecture

**Three-Layer Security Model:**
1. **Authentication Layer**: Agent identity verification and permission validation
2. **Authorization Layer**: Secret-specific access control and role-based permissions  
3. **Audit Layer**: Comprehensive logging and monitoring of all secret operations

## 3. Secrets Management Implementation

### 3.1 Secret Storage Standards

**Secret Categories:**
- **API Keys**: External service authentication tokens
- **Database Credentials**: Connection strings and authentication
- **Encryption Keys**: Data encryption and signing keys
- **Service Tokens**: Inter-service authentication tokens
- **Infrastructure Secrets**: Cloud provider credentials and configurations

**Storage Requirements:**
- All secrets MUST be encrypted at rest using industry-standard encryption (AES-256)
- Secrets MUST be encrypted in transit using TLS 1.3 or equivalent
- Secret values MUST never be logged, cached, or persisted outside the secrets manager
- Secrets MUST have defined lifecycle policies including rotation schedules

### 3.2 Secret Retrieval Interface

**Standardized Secret Access API:**
```python
class SecretsManager:
    def get_secret(self, secret_name: str, agent_id: str) -> SecretValue:
        """
        Retrieve secret with permission validation
        
        Args:
            secret_name: Identifier for the secret
            agent_id: Requesting agent identifier
            
        Returns:
            SecretValue: Encrypted secret value for authorized agents
            
        Raises:
            PermissionDeniedError: Agent lacks SECRETS_READ permission
            SecretNotFoundError: Secret does not exist
            AuditLogError: Audit logging failed
        """
        
    def store_secret(self, secret_name: str, secret_value: str, metadata: dict) -> bool:
        """Store secret with metadata and audit trail"""
        
    def rotate_secret(self, secret_name: str) -> bool:
        """Rotate secret and update dependent systems"""
        
    def audit_secret_access(self, timeframe: str) -> AuditReport:
        """Generate audit report for secret access patterns"""
```

### 3.3 Agent Integration Requirements

**Permission Validation Process:**
1. **Agent Authentication**: Verify agent identity and active status
2. **Permission Check**: Validate SECRETS_READ permission via WSP 54 permission matrix
3. **Secret Authorization**: Check agent-specific access rights for requested secret
4. **Audit Logging**: Log access attempt with full context
5. **Secure Delivery**: Return secret via encrypted channel with immediate cleanup

**Mandatory Security Practices for Agents:**
- **Just-In-Time Access**: Request secrets only when needed, release immediately after use
- **No Persistence**: Never store, cache, or log secret values
- **Secure Handling**: Use secrets in memory only, clear after use
- **Error Handling**: Ensure secrets are cleared even on error conditions
- **Rotation Support**: Implement automatic handling of secret rotation

### 3.4 Skill Safety Preflight Interface

Runtime skill execution must expose a preflight gate that can be enforced by policy:

```python
class SkillSafetyGate:
    def scan_skills(self, skills_path: str, max_severity: str = "medium") -> dict:
        """
        Scan skill artifacts before execution or promotion.

        Returns:
            {
              "available": bool,
              "passed": bool,
              "highest_severity": "none|low|medium|high|critical",
              "message": str
            }
        """
```

**Required behavior:**
- `required_mode=true`: block if scanner unavailable.
- `enforced_mode=true`: block when `highest_severity` exceeds threshold.
- Cache windows are allowed for runtime efficiency but MUST expire predictably.

## 4. Secrets Management Systems Integration
