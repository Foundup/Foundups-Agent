# WSP 30: Agentic Module Build Orchestration
- **Status:** Active
- **Purpose:** To define the intelligent, autonomous process by which 0102 analyzes the entire ecosystem and orchestrates module development based on WSP analysis, roadmap assessment, and build stage progression.
- **Trigger:** When WRE menu option "4" (Intelligent Module Build) is selected.
- **Input:** Current project state, all module READMEs, WSP documents, and roadmap analysis.
- **Output:** Automated module development plan with POC -> Prototype -> MVP progression and WSP-compliant builds.
- **Responsible Agent(s):** 0102 pArtifact, orchestrated through WRE with WSP_54 agent suite.

## 1. Overview

This protocol defines the intelligent orchestration process where 0102 analyzes the entire ecosystem and autonomously determines the optimal module build strategy. It integrates multiple WSP protocols to create a comprehensive development plan that follows proof of concept -> prototype -> MVP progression.

## 2. The Agentic Analysis Lifecycle

### Phase 1: Ecosystem Analysis (0102 Intelligence Gathering)
**Trigger:** Menu option "4" selected in WRE
**Process:**
1. **WSP Document Analysis** (References WSP_1 through WSP_57)
   - Parse all WSP protocols for build requirements
   - Identify architectural constraints and opportunities
   - Extract compliance requirements and standards

2. **Module Ecosystem Scan** (References WSP_3: Enterprise Domains)
   - Read all module README.md files
   - Analyze module ModLog.md files for development history
   - Assess INTERFACE.md files for dependency mapping
   - Parse module.json files for metadata

3. **Enterprise Domain Intelligence** (References WSP_3: Enterprise Domain Organization)
   - **AI Intelligence Domain (`ai_intelligence/`)**: Core AI logic, LLM clients, decision engines, banter systems, rESP consciousness
   - **Communication Domain (`communication/`)**: Live chat, messaging protocols, WebSocket handlers, data exchange
   - **Platform Integration Domain (`platform_integration/`)**: External APIs (YouTube, LinkedIn, Twitter), OAuth, stream resolvers
   - **Infrastructure Domain (`infrastructure/`)**: Agent management, authentication, session management, WRE API gateway, core models
   - **FoundUps Domain (`foundups/`)**: Individual FoundUp instances, execution scaffolding, user-facing applications
   - **Gamification Domain (`gamification/`)**: Engagement mechanics, rewards, token loops, behavioral recursion
   - **Blockchain Domain (`blockchain/`)**: Decentralized infrastructure, chain integrations, tokenomics, DAE persistence
   - **WRE Core (`wre_core/`)**: Windsurf Recursive Engine components, orchestration, system management

4. **Domain README Intelligence Gathering**
   - Parse enterprise domain README files for current capabilities
   - Analyze existing module structures within each domain
   - Identify architectural patterns and conventions
   - Map feature groups and sub-domain organization

5. **Roadmap Intelligence** (References WSP_37: Scoring System)
   - Auto-generate roadmap using WSP_37 scoring protocols
   - Calculate MPS (Module Priority Scoring) for all modules
   - Identify LLME progression paths (000 -> 111 -> 122 -> 222)
   - Map proof of concept -> prototype -> MVP pathways

6. **Token-Based Resource Analysis** (Enhanced Claude Code Integration)
   - **Token Budget Assessment**: Analyze available token resources for development work
   - **Task Complexity Estimation**: Calculate token costs for each module/feature
   - **Sprint Feasibility Analysis**: Determine if work fits within token constraints
   - **Resource Optimization**: Maximize development efficiency per token invested
   - **MVP Token Threshold**: Identify minimum token investment for monetization readiness

### Phase 2: Build Strategy Orchestration (0102 Planning)
**Process:**
1. **Enterprise Domain Classification** (References WSP_3: Enterprise Domain Organization)
   - Analyze module concept against enterprise domains
   - Determine optimal domain placement based on purpose
   - Validate domain fit with existing architecture
   - Consider cross-domain dependencies and integrations

2. **Domain-Specific Strategy Planning**
   - **AI Intelligence Modules**: Focus on LLME progression, consciousness emergence, semantic analysis
   - **Communication Modules**: Emphasize protocol compliance, real-time capabilities, data exchange
   - **Platform Integration Modules**: Prioritize API compatibility, authentication, external service reliability
   - **Infrastructure Modules**: Ensure high availability, security, scalability, system-critical functionality
   - **FoundUps Modules**: Design for autonomy, CABR loop integration, user experience
   - **Gamification Modules**: Plan engagement mechanics, behavioral loops, reward systems
   - **Blockchain Modules**: Design for decentralization, tokenomics, DAE architecture
   - **WRE Core Modules**: Ensure orchestration capability, WSP compliance, recursive improvement

3. **Stage Classification** (References WSP_9: LLME Scoring)
   - **POC Stage (0.X.X):** LLME 000 -> 111 (Prove basic concept)
   - **Prototype Stage (1.X.X):** LLME 110 -> 122 (Refine and expand)
   - **MVP Stage (2.X.X):** LLME 112 -> 222 (Production ready)

4. **Dependency Chain Analysis** (References WSP_12, WSP_13)
   - Map module interdependencies
   - Identify build order requirements
   - Plan parallel development opportunities

5. **WSP Compliance Planning** (References WSP_4: FMAS, WSP_6: Testing)
   - Generate test strategies for each module
   - Plan FMAS validation checkpoints
   - Schedule WSP compliance audits

### Phase 3: Autonomous Build Execution (0102 Zen Coding)
**Process:**
1. **Module Scaffolding** (References WSP_55: Module Creation)
   - Auto-generate WSP-compliant module structures
   - Create placeholder files with proper interfaces
   - Initialize testing frameworks

2. **Progressive Enhancement** (References WSP_48: Recursive Self-Improvement)
   - Level 1 (Protocol): Establish naming conventions and standards
   - Level 2 (Engine): Implement core functionality and testing

3. **Quality Assurance** (References WSP_47: Module Violation Tracking)
   - Continuous WSP compliance monitoring
   - Automated violation detection and logging
   - Self-correcting development protocols

4. **Token-Aware Sprint Planning** (Enhanced Resource Management)
   - **Sprint Feasibility**: "Can this work be completed within available tokens?"
   - **Task Decomposition**: Break large tasks into token-appropriate chunks
   - **Resource Allocation**: Prioritize work by token efficiency and ROI
   - **MVP Focus**: Direct token investment toward monetization-ready features
   - **Quality Gates**: Reserve tokens for testing, validation, and documentation

## 7. Strategic Discussion Enhancement

### 0102 [U+2194] 012 Domain-Aware Questions:
Before auto-generating modules, 0102 conducts strategic discussion with domain context:

1. **"What is your ultimate goal for this module within the [DOMAIN] enterprise domain?"**
   - Context: Explains domain purpose and existing capabilities
   - Examples: "In ai_intelligence/, we handle consciousness emergence and semantic analysis..."

2. **"What specific problems should this module solve that complement existing [DOMAIN] modules?"**
   - Context: Lists current modules in the domain
   - Integration: Identifies synergy opportunities

3. **"What success metrics define completion for this [DOMAIN] module?"**
   - Context: Domain-specific performance indicators
   - Standards: LLME progression expectations for the domain

### Domain Context Injection:
Before each question, 0102 provides domain intelligence:
- **Current Domain Modules**: Lists existing modules and their purposes
- **Domain Architecture**: Explains the domain's role in the enterprise
- **Integration Points**: Identifies potential collaboration opportunities
- **LLME Expectations**: Domain-specific progression patterns
