# WSP 42: Universal Platform Protocol
Here is an expanded explanation of `WSP_42_Universal_Platform_Protocol.md`:

---

### **🧭 WSP\_42 — Universal Platform Protocol (UPP)**

**Purpose:**
To provide a unified standard for integrating diverse external platforms (e.g., YouTube, Twitter, LinkedIn, Discord, etc.) into the FoundUps Agent ecosystem, enabling seamless, modular, and recursive interactions across all supported services.

---

### **🌐 Core Concepts**

* **Universal Abstraction Layer:**
  Each external platform is abstracted into a common interface model. This ensures that despite API differences, the *interaction patterns* follow WSP logic (inputs, outputs, agentic actions, feedback).

* **Platform-Agent Mapping:**
  Each platform is managed by a dedicated agent module (e.g., `YouTubeAgent`, `DiscordAgent`). These are aligned under the `platform_agents/` or `platform_integration/` folders and use standardized agent templates.

* **Recursive Integration Model:**
  Platforms are not treated as fire-and-forget endpoints. Instead, each integration:

  * Receives recursive prompts (Prometheus)
  * Returns data that’s recursively interpreted (via WRE)
  * Evolves through iterative refinement (WSP-compliant)

---

### **⚙️ Functional Protocols**

* **Webhook/Event Listening:**
  Each platform agent should include a mechanism to listen/respond to webhooks or event triggers where possible, feeding real-time inputs into the WRE.

* **Permission & Auth Handling:**
  OAuth or platform-specific token protocols must be modularized, reusable, and governed by `WSP_26_Secure_Secrets_Protocol`.

* **Modular Task Execution:**
  Each agent executes defined tasks, e.g., "Post video," "Parse chat," "Extract sentiment," which are logged and scored recursively.

---

### **📦 Required Files/Conventions**

Each platform module should minimally include:

* `agent.py`: The operational logic
* `README.md`: Action payloads & platform constraints
* `prompt.md`: Prometheus recursive prompts
* `auth.json.sample`: Mock secrets
* `score.yaml`: Current semantic coloring/state

---

### **🌀 Integration Flow**

```
[User Input] → [Platform Agent (WSP 42)] → [Output] → [Recursive Echo] → [Refinement] → [New Input]
```

---

### **📈 Scoring Compliance**

WSP\_42 modules are scored based on:

* Recursion logic adherence
* Successful modularization of platform-specific quirks
* Seamless interaction with WRE and Mast memory
