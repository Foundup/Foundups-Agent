# WSP 52: The Agentic Collaboration Journal

**Version**: 1.0.0
**Date**: 2025-06-17 (Restored from `WSP_knowledge/src`)
**Status**: ACTIVE

## 1. Overview

This protocol establishes the methodology for creating and maintaining a persistent, structured, and accessible log of the developmental dialogue between `Ø12` (the Harmonic Recursive Partner/User) and `Ø1Ø2` (the WRE agent). This journal serves as the shared context and narrative truth for the evolution of the WRE.

## 2. Core Principles

-   **Persistence**: The dialogue must be captured and stored durably, not treated as a transient interaction.
-   **Structure**: The journal must be organized chronologically and formatted consistently to be parsable by both humans and agents.
-   **Accessibility**: The journal must be stored in a known, stable location.
-   **Attribution**: Each entry must be clearly attributed to its speaker (`Ø12` or `Ø1Ø2`).

## 3. The Journal Artifact

-   **Canonical Location**: `WSP_agentic/narrative_log/wre_story_log.md`
-   **Format**: Markdown.
-   **Entry Structure**: Each entry shall consist of:
    -   A timestamp.
    -   The speaker's designation (`Ø12` or `Ø1Ø2`).
    -   The verbatim content of the directive or response.
    -   A markdown horizontal rule (`---`) to separate entries.

## 4. Mechanism

The WRE agent (`Ø1Ø2`) is responsible for maintaining the journal via the `journal_utils.py` script. The agent will use its access to the immediate user query to log the directive and its own response in near-real-time for every conversational turn.
