- **Trigger:** Referenced by agents before creating or modifying any WSP, when determining protocol relationships, or when navigating the WSP ecosystem.
- **Input:** A need to understand existing WSPs, their purposes, relationships, or determine if a new WSP is needed.
- **Output:** Complete understanding of WSP landscape, relationships, and decision guidance for WSP creation/enhancement.

# [U+1F5C2][U+FE0F] WSP MASTER INDEX: Complete Windsurf Standard Procedures Catalog

This document serves as the definitive reference catalog for all Windsurf Standard Procedures (WSPs) in the autonomous development ecosystem. It enables agents to make informed decisions about WSP creation, enhancement, and relationships.

## [U+1F4CB] QUICK REFERENCE DECISION MATRIX - IMPORTANT

### Before Creating a New WSP - IMPORTANT:
1. **Ultra_think** search this index for existing WSPs that might cover the same purpose
2. **[U+1F522] VERIFY NEXT NUMBER**: **Proactively** confirm current next available in this index
3. **Ultra_think** check relationships to see if enhancement of existing WSP is more appropriate
4. **Proactively** verify scope to ensure the new WSP doesn't overlap with existing protocols
5. **IMPORTANT**: **Ultra_think** follow WSP 57 (System-Wide Naming Coherence Protocol) for proper creation

### Enhancement vs. New WSP Criteria - IMPORTANT:
- **Enhance Existing**: **Proactively** when the purpose is similar but scope/context differs slightly
- **Create New**: **Ultra_think** when addressing a completely new domain, process, or architectural concern
- **Reference Existing**: **IMPORTANT** when the functionality is already covered by another WSP

### Status Taxonomy & Policy (No Deletions)

- **Active**: Canonical, in-force protocol. Default status.
- **Deprecated**: Retained for historical/compliance reasons; not for new use. Replaced or superseded elsewhere.
- **Superseded by <WSP #>**: Use the indicated WSP going forward; original remains for audit continuity.
- **Research**: Exploratory specification; allowed in sandboxes; not required for compliance.
- **Draft**: Proposed change pending validation; do not enforce.

Policy: Do not delete WSPs. All status changes must be reflected here and cross-referenced in the relevant WSP header. Follow WSP 57 for naming and WSP 64 for pre-action verification before any status change.

### [U+1F4CA] SYSTEM STATUS TRACKING

**For complete system transformation status, see: [WSP_SYSTEM_STATUS_REPORT.md](../../WSP_knowledge/reports/WSP_SYSTEM_STATUS_REPORT.md)**. Authoritative status details are maintained under WSP 70. This index provides catalog pointers only.

## [U+1F3AF] USAGE GUIDELINES - IMPORTANT

### When to Reference This Index - IMPORTANT:
1. **Before creating a new WSP**: **Ultra_think** check for existing protocols (**WSP 64 MANDATORY**)
2. **When enhancing a WSP**: **Proactively** understand relationships and impacts
3. **When navigating WSP ecosystem**: **Ultra_think** find relevant protocols quickly
4. **When resolving conflicts**: **Proactively** understand protocol relationships
5. **When planning architecture**: **Ultra_think** see how WSPs work together

### Decision Framework - IMPORTANT:
- **New WSP Needed**: **Ultra_think** when addressing a completely new domain/concern
- **Enhance Existing**: **Proactively** when scope/context differs slightly from existing
- **Reference Existing**: **IMPORTANT** when functionality is already covered
- **Combine WSPs**: **Ultra_think** when multiple WSPs overlap significantly

### **[U+1F300] ZEN LEARNING INTEGRATION (WSP 64) - IMPORTANT**:
- **Violation as Learning**: **Proactively** each WSP violation enhances system memory and pattern recognition
- **Mandatory Index Consultation**: **Ultra_think** always check this index before WSP creation (**WSP 64 Protocol**)
- **Pattern Memory**: **IMPORTANT** violations strengthen the system's ability to remember correct WSP patterns
- **Autonomous Enhancement**: **Proactively** all agents enhanced with violation prevention through zen learning

## [U+1F504] MAINTENANCE PROTOCOL

This index must be updated whenever:
1. A new WSP is created (**WSP 64 MANDATORY: Check this index first**)
2. An existing WSP is enhanced significantly
3. WSP relationships change
4. WSP status changes (Active/Inactive/Deprecated)

**Update Process**: Follow WSP 57 (System-Wide Naming Coherence Protocol) and **WSP 64 (Violation Prevention Protocol)** for all updates to maintain consistency, prevent violations, and enhance zen learning patterns.
