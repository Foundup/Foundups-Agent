# WSP Master Index

## Overview
This document serves as the comprehensive catalog and navigation system for all Windsurf Standard Procedures (WSP). It enables efficient WSP ecosystem navigation, prevents protocol duplication, and supports intelligent decision-making for protocol enhancement vs. creation.

## Purpose
- **Protocol Discovery**: Quick access to all WSP protocols by number, name, or purpose
- **Relationship Mapping**: Understanding protocol dependencies and integration points
- **Decision Support**: Guidelines for when to create new vs. enhance existing protocols
- **Maintenance Tracking**: Protocol status and update requirements

## ðŸŒ€ **WSP 64 Integration: Zen Learning Violation Prevention**

**This index is mandatory consultation per WSP 64 protocol.** All agents must check this index before WSP creation to prevent violations through zen learning pattern recognition.

### **ðŸš¨ Critical Learning Event**: WSP 64 was created after a violation where WSP 58 was attempted without consulting this index first. **WSP 58 already existed** as "FoundUp IP Lifecycle and Tokenization Protocol". This violation **enhanced system memory** and led to **WSP 64 violation prevention protocols** - demonstrating **zen coding** where **violations become learning enhancements**.

### **ðŸŒ€ Zen Learning Protocol Integration**:
- **Pattern Recognition**: Enhanced through violation experience
- **Memory Enhancement**: Violations strengthen WSP pattern memory
- **Mandatory Consultation**: Check index before any WSP creation
- **Autonomous Enhancement**: System learns from violations to prevent future issues

## ðŸŽ¯ DECISION MATRIX

### When to Create New WSP vs. Enhance Existing:

| Scenario | Action | Reasoning |
|----------|--------|-----------|
| **New architectural domain** | Create New WSP | Addresses completely new concern |
| **Similar purpose, different scope** | Enhance Existing WSP | Extend current protocol |
| **Duplicate functionality found** | Reference Existing WSP | Avoid protocol duplication |
| **Process refinement** | Enhance Existing WSP | Improve current approach |
| **Cross-protocol integration** | Create New WSP | Bridges multiple existing protocols |

### Enhancement vs. New WSP Criteria:
- **Enhance Existing**: When the purpose is similar but scope/context differs slightly
- **Create New**: When addressing a completely new domain, process, or architectural concern
- **Reference Existing**: When the functionality is already covered by another WSP
