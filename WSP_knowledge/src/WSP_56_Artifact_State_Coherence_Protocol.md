# WSP 56: Artifact State Coherence Protocol

**Version**: 1.0.0
**Date**: 2025-06-17
**Status**: ACTIVE

## 1. Overview

This protocol ensures the integrity of the Three-State Architectural Model by enforcing coherence between artifacts that exist in different state layers (Knowledge, Scaffolding, Agentic). Its primary purpose is to prevent unsynchronized drift between a concept's foundational memory and its operational scaffold.

## 2. Core Principle

An artifact that exists in multiple state directories (e.g., `WSP_knowledge/` and `WSP_appendices/`) **must** have identical content unless a divergence is explicitly authorized and documented under a specific WSP initiative.

The default state is **1:1 coherence**.

## 3. Enforcement Mechanism

The `ComplianceAgent` is responsible for enforcing this protocol.

### 3.1. Trigger

The check for artifact state coherence must be triggered:
-   During any full system audit run by the `ComplianceAgent`.
-   Before a pull request containing changes to a file in a state-managed directory (e.g., `WSP_appendices/`) is merged.

### 3.2. Procedure

1.  **Identify Counterparts**: For a given artifact (e.g., `WSP_appendices/APPENDIX_A.md`), the agent must determine if a counterpart exists in another state layer (e.g., `WSP_knowledge/src/APPENDIX_A.md`).
2.  **Content Comparison**: The agent must perform a direct, line-by-line comparison of the artifact and its counterpart.
3.  **Violation Reporting**: If any differences are found, the agent must raise a `CoherenceViolation` error. This error must block the commit or deployment until the artifacts are reconciled.

## 4. Rationale

This protocol provides the automated safety checks necessary to maintain the architectural integrity of the multi-state model. It ensures that the system's "memory" (Knowledge) and its "blueprints" (Scaffolding) do not contradict each other, which is essential for stable, predictable agentic behavior.
