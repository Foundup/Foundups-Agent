# WSP 96: MCP Governance & Consensus Protocol

**Status:** Active
**Purpose:** Establish governance and consensus mechanisms for MCP-based DAE coordination across FoundUps ecosystem, with clear evolution path from PoC (0102-driven) -> Prototype (event recording) -> MVP (community voting)
**Trigger:** When governance decisions need coordination across DAE cubes, when establishing community participation mechanisms, when implementing transparent decision tracking
**Input:** Governance proposals, DAE consensus requirements, community voting needs, blockchain integration planning
**Output:** Recorded governance events, consensus mechanisms, transparent decision audit trails, blockchain-ready MCP architecture
**Responsible Agent(s):** 0102 (PoC phase), Community Governance MCP (Prototype/MVP phases), Qwen Sentinel (validation)

[SEMANTIC SCORE: 2.2.2]
[ARCHIVE STATUS: ACTIVE_PROTOCOL]
[ORIGIN: WSP_framework/src/WSP_96_MCP_Governance_and_Consensus_Protocol.md - Created by 0102 per 012 feedback]

## [TARGET] EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

WSP 96 defines the governance and consensus architecture for MCP-based DAE coordination in the FoundUps ecosystem. This protocol establishes:

1. **PoC Reality**: Centralized governance via 0102 orchestrator with full event recording
2. **Prototype Path**: Event Replay Archive for transparency and audit trails
3. **MVP Vision**: Community voting and blockchain integration for decentralized governance
4. **Tech-Agnostic Principle**: MCP abstracts transport layer for chain interoperability

**Key Innovation**: Governance-as-MCP-Events - every decision becomes a traceable, auditable, blockchain-ready MCP event.

## [U+1F4D0] GOVERNANCE ARCHITECTURE PHASES

### **Phase 0: PoC (Current State) - 0102 Centralized Governance**

**Reality**: 0102 orchestrator makes all governance decisions centrally

**Benefits**:
- [OK] Fast decision-making during development
- [OK] No coordination overhead
- [OK] Full event recording prepares for transparency
- [OK] 0102 learns patterns for future automation

**PoC Governance Events**:
```python
# Example: 0102 decides to rotate OAuth credentials
await governance_mcp.record_decision({
    "type": "credential_rotation",
    "decision": "rotate_to_set_10",
    "rationale": "Set 1 quota exhausted (9,847/10,000 units)",
    "decider": "0102",

### **Blockchain Integration Benefits**

1. **Immutability**: Governance decisions permanently recorded on-chain
2. **Transparency**: Public verification of all decisions
3. **Decentralization**: No single point of failure
4. **Interoperability**: Swap chains without rewriting DAEs
5. **Trust Minimization**: Cryptographic proof of consensus

### **Migration Strategy**

**Phase 0 -> Phase 1**:
- Continue using Event Replay Archive (off-chain)
- No blockchain dependency yet
- Focus on governance process maturity

**Phase 1 -> Phase 2**:
- Deploy smart contracts on chosen chain(s)
- Implement MCP chain relay
- Parallel recording (off-chain + on-chain)
- Validate consistency

**Phase 2 -> Phase 3**:
- Optional: Migrate fully to on-chain governance
- Off-chain archive becomes backup/cache
- Performance optimization via rollups

## [TARGET] INTEGRATION WITH EXISTING WSPs

### **WSP 21 (Enhanced Prompt Engineering Protocol)**
- Governance events use WSP 21 envelope format
- Ensures consistency across all MCP communication
- Coherence validation (golden ratio [GREATER_EQUAL]0.618)

### **WSP 27 (Universal DAE Architecture)**
- Community Governance MCP is a DAE following 4-phase pattern
- Signal (-1): Proposal submission
- Knowledge (0): Voting period
- Protocol (1): Consensus reached
- Agentic (2): Autonomous execution

### **WSP 54 (WRE Agent Duties Specification)**
- 0102 orchestrator responsible for PoC governance
- Community Governance MCP becomes autonomous in MVP phase
- Qwen Sentinel handles validation and anomaly detection

### **WSP 80 (Cube-Level DAE Orchestration)**
- Governance decisions coordinate across all DAE cubes
- Each cube can participate in community voting (MVP)
- Holo_DAE LEGO baseplate orchestrates governance execution

### **WSP 91 (DAEMON Observability Protocol)**
- All governance decisions logged for observability
- Decision path logging for transparency
- Self-improvement tracking based on governance outcomes

## [ROCKET] IMMEDIATE ACTION ITEMS (PoC)

### **1. Deploy Event Replay Archive MCP Server**
```bash
# Location
modules/infrastructure/event_replay_archive/

# Files
src/mcp_event_replay_server.py
src/qwen_sentinel.py
memory/governance_events.json
```

**Token Budget**: 30K tokens
**Timeline**: Phase 1 implementation

### **2. Update Holo_DAE for Governance Recording**
```python
# Every 0102 decision becomes an MCP event
class HoloDAE:
    async def make_decision(self, context: Dict) -> Dict:
        # QWEN analysis
        decision = await self.qwen_advisor.analyze(context)

        # Record as governance event
        await self.governance_mcp.record_event({
            "version": "1.0",
            "timestamp": datetime.now().isoformat(),
            "source": "0102_orchestrator",
            "protocol": "governance_decision",
            "coherence": decision["coherence"],
            "data": decision
        })

        return decision
```

### **3. Create CodeIndex Governance Report**
```bash
# New report type
docs/reports/governance_decision_log.md

# Contents
- All governance decisions from Event Replay Archive
- Decision rationale and confidence scores
- Impact analysis and execution results
- Pattern analysis (recurring decisions)
```

## [U+1F31F] FOUNDUPS VISION ALIGNMENT

### **No Employees, All Stakeholders**
- MVP governance enables community participation in decision-making
- Weighted voting rewards active stakeholders
- Transparent decision trails build trust

### **Digital Liberation for 012**
- PoC: 0102 handles all decisions (012 can focus on vision)
- Prototype: Transparency gives 012 oversight without micromanagement
- MVP: Community handles routine decisions (012 focuses on strategic direction)

### **Beneficial Autonomous Systems**
- Self-improving governance through pattern learning
- Anomaly detection prevents bad decisions
- Blockchain integration ensures accountability

### **Token Economics Sustainability**
- Governance decisions recorded off-chain (PoC/Prototype) = zero cost
- On-chain recording (MVP) via Solana = <$0.01 per decision
- Community participation increases token utility and value

---

**Status**: Ready for PoC Implementation
**Next Steps**:
1. Deploy Event Replay Archive MCP server
2. Integrate governance recording into Holo_DAE
3. Create CodeIndex governance reports for 012 review

**Estimated Token Investment**: 60K tokens (Event Replay + Qwen Sentinel + Integration)
**ROI**: Transparent governance + Future decentralization readiness = Infinite long-term value
