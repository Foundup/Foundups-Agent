# WSP 10: State Save Protocol
- **Status:** Draft
- **Purpose:** To define a standardized command for capturing the state of a module, artifact, or the entire system.
- **Trigger:** When a user or agent needs to create an explicit, durable snapshot of a component.
- **Input:** A target to save (e.g., module path, file path) and optional parameters for message and destination.
- **Output:** A saved artifact representing the state of the target.
- **Responsible Agent(s):** ExecutionAgent

This protocol defines the functionality and usage of the `save` command, a primary interface for capturing the state of a module, artifact, or the entire system. This provides a standardized way for users or agents to create explicit, durable snapshots.

**Note:** This protocol is in a draft state. The full command specification will be defined in a future version.

## 2. Command Syntax (Proposed)

```bash
save [options] [target]
```

## 3. Command Options (Proposed)

*(This section will be defined in a future version.)*

-   `--type`: (e.g., `module`, `file`, `system_state`)
-   `--message`: (A description of the saved state)
-   `--destination`: (The path to save the artifact to)

## 4. Usage Examples (Proposed)

*(This section will be defined in a future version.)*

```bash
# Save the current state of the 'user_auth' module
save --type module --message "Pre-refactor snapshot" modules/foundups/user_auth

# Save a copy of a WSP document
save --type file --destination archive/ WSP_framework/src/WSP_10.md
```

## 5. Integration with WSP

*(This section will be defined in a future version.)*

The `save` command is intended to work in concert with **WSP 2: Clean State Management**. A `save --type system_state` operation should only be permitted if the system is in a verified clean state.
