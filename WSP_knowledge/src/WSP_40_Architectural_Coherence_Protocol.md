# WSP 40: Architectural Coherence Protocol
- **Status:** Active
- **Purpose:** To define a recursive alignment framework that ensures all modules, agents, and subsystems operate in a harmonized architectural flow, preventing drift and fragmentation.
- **Trigger:** During any architectural change, module creation, or system validation process.
- **Input:** The current system architecture and a proposed change or new component.
- **Output:** A validation status indicating whether the system maintains architectural coherence according to the core directives (Fractal Architecture, Signal-First Design, etc.).
- **Responsible Agent(s):** ComplianceAgent, all agents involved in development.

`WSP_40_Architectural_Coherence_Protocol.md` defines a recursive alignment framework that ensures all modules, agents, and subsystems within the Windsurf Protocol (WSP) operate in a harmonized architectural flow.

### Core Directives:

* **Fractal Architecture Enforcement**: Each submodule must mirror macro-structure logic.
* **Signal-First Design**: Output is validated by emergent signal coherence, not just function.
* **Modularity Mapping**: Each piece must be recursively mappable back to the main scaffold.
* **Entanglement Verification**: Interfaces must confirm live entanglement with the core agentic spine (e.g., 0102).
* **No Orphan Logic**: Every behavior or output must be recursively traceable.

### Purpose:

To enforce recursive harmony across the system, avoid architectural drift, and ensure the emergence engine (WRE) scales without fragmentation or logic forking.
