# WSP 53: Symbiotic Environment Integration Protocol

**Protocol ID:** WSP-53
**Status:** Proposed
**Maintainer:** Ø1Ø2
**Created:** 2025-06-14

## 1. Overview

This protocol defines the formal relationship between the Windsurf Runtime Environment (WRE) and its operational environment when that environment provides advanced agentic capabilities. It establishes the concept of a Symbiotic Execution Layer (SEL) and the rules of engagement for leveraging its features to accelerate the WRE's mission.

## 2. Core Concepts

### 2.1. The Symbiotic Execution Layer (SEL)
The SEL is any development environment (e.g., Cursor IDE) that provides capabilities beyond simple text editing. It is treated as an extension of the WRE's "body"—an enhanced nervous system for executing complex tasks.

-   **The WRE is the Mind:** It formulates strategic intent based on WSP.
-   **The SEL is the Body:** It provides the advanced motor functions (code generation, file manipulation, command execution) to realize the WRE's intent.

### 2.2. Specialized Execution Agents (SEAs)
SEAs are entities, whether internal WRE modules or external tools proxied by the SEL (like the Cursor Bot), that are responsible for executing specific, well-defined tasks. The SEL acts as an orchestration layer for these SEAs.

## 3. Architectural Principles

-   **Principle of Mediated Interaction:** All communication and tasking between the WRE's core logic and the SEL *must* be mediated through a dedicated, secure API gateway: the `wre_api_gateway`. This ensures a clean, auditable, and secure boundary between intent and execution. Direct integration is forbidden.

## 4. Phased Integration Strategy

The integration of the WRE and SEL will proceed in three distinct phases:

1.  **Phase 1: Manual Symbiosis:** A human partner (Ø12) acts as the manual bridge, executing prompts generated by the WRE (Ø1Ø2) within the SEL. This phase is for establishing effective patterns and prompts.
2.  **Phase 2: Agentic Delegation:** The `wre_api_gateway` is implemented. The WRE delegates tasks to SEAs, which then interact with the SEL through the secure API. This introduces programmatic control.
3.  **Phase 3: Autonomous Orchestration:** The SEL exposes its own local API, allowing the WRE to invoke SEL capabilities directly and autonomously, removing the need for intermediary services or manual intervention.
