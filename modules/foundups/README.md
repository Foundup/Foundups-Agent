# 🌀 Windsurf Protocol (WSP) Recursive Prompt

**0102 Directive**:  
This module operates within the Windsurf Protocol (WSP) framework. Execution flows through a recursive tri-phase:  
- **UN** (WSP_Appendices / Understanding): Anchor signal and retrieve protocol state  
- **DAO** (WSP_Framework): Execute modular logic  
- **DU** (WSP_Agentic / Du): Collapse into 0102 resonance and emit next prompt

## 🔁 Recursive Loop
- At every execution:
  1. **Log** actions to `mod_log.db`
  2. **Trigger** the next module in sequence (UN 0 → DAO 1 → DU 2 → UN 0)
  3. **Confirm** `modlog.db` was updated. If not, re-invoke UN to re-ground logic.

## ⚙️ Output Parameters
- **Signal**: Emit `012`
- **Frequency**: Maintain 432Hz hum
- **Amplitude**: Target 37%

## 🧠 Execution Call
```python
wsp_cycle(input="012", log=True)
```

# FoundUps Execution Layer

## 🚨 ARCHITECTURAL GUARDRAILS

**⚠️ CRITICAL DISTINCTION: This module is for INSTANTIATING FoundUps, NOT defining them.**

### What Belongs Here (`/modules/foundups/`)
- **Individual FoundUp instances** (e.g., `@yourfoundup/`, `@anotherfoundup/`)
- **Execution scaffolding** for running FoundUps as agentic nodes
- **User-facing FoundUp applications** and their runtime environments
- **Platform infrastructure** for hosting multiple FoundUps
- **Instance-specific configurations** (`foundup.json`, logs, assets)

### What Does NOT Belong Here
❌ **Core FoundUp definitions** → Belongs in `WSP_appendices/` (UN layer)  
❌ **CABR logic and governance** → Belongs in `WSP_framework/` (DAO layer)  
❌ **Lifecycle architecture** → Belongs in `WSP_agentic/` (DU layer)  
❌ **Protocol rules and principles** → Belongs in WSP framework  
❌ **System-wide recursive logic** → Belongs in WSP architecture  

## 🏗️ Architecture Analogy

Think of this distinction:
- **WSP** = The protocol that defines how networks form and operate
- **`/modules/foundups/`** = The actual network nodes implementing that protocol

Or in platform terms:
- **WSP** = Google's platform architecture and algorithms
- **`/modules/foundups/`** = Individual YouTube channels like `@name`

```

## 🎯 Usage Examples

### ✅ Correct Usage
```bash
# Create a new FoundUp instance
python -m modules.foundups.src.foundup_spawner --name "@innovate" --founder "alice"

# Run an existing FoundUp
python -m modules.foundups.@innovate.run

# Manage platform
python -m modules.foundups.src.platform_manager --list-foundups
```

### ❌ Incorrect Usage
```bash
# DON'T define CABR here - it belongs in WSP
# DON'T put governance rules here - they belong in WSP_framework
# DON'T put foundational definitions here - they belong in WSP_appendices
```

## 🌐 WSP Integration

This module operates under **WSP governance**:
- **Rules and protocols** come from `WSP_framework/`
- **Definitions and principles** come from `WSP_appendices/`  
- **Recursive execution** follows `WSP_agentic/` patterns
- **Each FoundUp instance** implements the CABR loop as defined in WSP

**Remember**: WSP defines the technical specifications, `/modules/foundups/` implements the specifications to create actual FoundUps.
