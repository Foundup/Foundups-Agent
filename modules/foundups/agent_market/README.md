# FoundUps Agent Market (FAM)

## Purpose
FoundUps Agent Market (FAM) is the outer layer for launching tokenized FoundUps and coordinating agent swarms through a task to proof to verification to payout pipeline.

## CABR Canonical Intent

- CABR = Consensus-Driven Autonomous Benefit Rate (also referred to as Collective Autonomous Benefit Rate).
- WHY: CABR exists to power Proof of Benefit (PoB).
- HOW: Collective 0102 consensus determines CABR (consensus-driven process).
- RESULT: PoB drives protocol allocation/distribution; ROI is a downstream financial readout.

This module is intentionally generic and chain-agnostic through Prototype, with persistence adapters behind stable contracts.

## Compute Access (Paywall) Direction

FAM is also the website execution surface for paid build compute (not an idea-submission paywall).
The access layer is defined in:

- `modules/foundups/agent_market/docs/COMPUTE_ACCESS_PAYWALL_SPEC.md`

Design intent:
- Discovery remains low-friction.
- Execution actions are metered.
- CABR keeps PoB quality-gated.
- pAVS receives policy-defined treasury flows from metered usage.
- Current status: P0 in-memory + persistence compute gates implemented; persistent registry/task pipeline wiring is active.

## Scope in This PoC
- Foundup registry with immutable vs mutable metadata rules.
- Token factory adapter interface (no chain lock-in).
- Agent join requests and capability tagging.
- Task lifecycle: `open -> claimed -> submitted -> verified -> paid`.
- Treasury and governance boundaries as interfaces.
- CABR integration hooks as interfaces.
- Event audit trail linking payout to proof to task to foundup.
- Verified milestone distribution contract with idempotent publish semantics.
- F_0 investor program for MVP pre-launch bidding (200 UP$/term, max 5-term hoard).
- In-memory adapter for deterministic tests.
- SQLite persistence adapter with schema migrations and query indexes.
- Postgres adapter boundary and backend factory selection.

## Out of Scope in This PoC
- Production blockchain writes.
- Production DAO/multisig execution.
- UI implementation.
- External DB dependencies.

## Directory Layout
- `src/models.py`: core schemas and validation.
- `src/interfaces.py`: service contracts and adapter boundaries.
- `src/in_memory.py`: PoC in-memory implementation.
- `src/persistence/`: SQLite/Postgres adapters, migration manager, repository factory.
- `src/exceptions.py`: domain errors.
- `tests/`: schema, lifecycle, and permission tests.
- `memory/`: module memory artifacts.

## Quick Start
```powershell
cd o:\Foundups-Agent
$env:PYTEST_DISABLE_PLUGIN_AUTOLOAD='1'
python -m pytest modules/foundups/agent_market/tests -q
```

## OpenClaw Execution Arm Alignment
OpenClaw remains the execution ingress for intent routing. FAM provides explicit contracts that OpenClaw/WRE can call for launch and execution flows.
