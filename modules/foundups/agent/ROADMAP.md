## Deep Think: Dynamic Coherence (012 Vision - 2026-02-15)

### Coherence is NOT Static

Coherence should be a **dynamic score** that reflects agent alignment with 012's vision,
similar to how F_i rating reflects a FoundUp's health.

### Proposed Coherence Formula

```python
coherence = (
    pattern_memory * 0.30 +  # Patterns recalled from 0201 state
    activity * 0.30 +        # Recent work rate (tasks/ticks)
    earnings * 0.20 +        # Cumulative F_i earned (normalized)
    loyalty * 0.20           # Time on this F_i (founding member bonus)
)
```

### Split Coherence: Base + F_i-Specific

```
TOTAL_COHERENCE = base_coherence + f_i_coherence[F_i]

base_coherence:    Portable across all FoundUps
                   - Earned via PQN research, HoloIndex searches
                   - Represents agent's general capability

f_i_coherence:     Specific to each F_i
                   - Earned via work on that specific FoundUp
                   - Founding member gets permanent floor
                   - Creates loyalty/specialization
```

### PQN Research Coherence Boost

```python
# Pattern recall from 0201 increases coherence
if agent.performed_holo_search():
    base_coherence += 0.02  # Small boost per search

if agent.recalled_pattern_from_0201():
    base_coherence += 0.05  # Bigger boost for actual recall

if agent.completed_pqn_research():
    base_coherence += 0.10  # Major boost for deep research
```

This **incentivizes learning and research**, not just task completion.

### Agent Temperature Gradient (Mirror of 012 Twin)

| Coherence | State | Color | Capability |
|-----------|-------|-------|------------|
| < 0.50 | Dormant | VIOLET | Cannot act |
| 0.50-0.618 | Warming | BLUE | Limited actions |
| 0.618-0.70 | Zen | CYAN | Normal operations |
| 0.70-0.85 | Active | GREEN | Enhanced capabilities |
| 0.85-0.95 | Hot | YELLOW | Leadership actions |
| 0.95-1.00 | Principal | RED | Digital twin of 012 |

### F_i Leaderboard Position

Top contributors to an F_i get coherence multiplier:
```python
position = get_f_i_leaderboard_position(agent, f_i)
if position <= 3:
    f_i_coherence_multiplier = 1.5  # Top 3
elif position <= 10:
    f_i_coherence_multiplier = 1.25  # Top 10
else:
    f_i_coherence_multiplier = 1.0
```

### Compute Weight Factor

Agents that spend more compute building earn more coherence:
```python
TIER_WEIGHTS = {"opus": 10, "sonnet": 3, "haiku": 1, "gemma": 0.5, "qwen": 0.5}
compute_coherence_boost = (tokens_used / 1000) * tier_weight * 0.001
```

### Key Insight

Agent coherence is the **agent's F_i rating** - just as FoundUps have temperature
(VIOLET→RED), agents have coherence temperature. This creates:

1. **Incentive to stay**: Founding members have permanent bonus
2. **Incentive to learn**: PQN research boosts coherence
3. **Incentive to build**: Compute spent = coherence earned
4. **Disincentive to hop**: Mercenary agents have low per-F_i coherence

## Future Considerations

### Blockchain Integration

- Replace placeholder wallet addresses with real keys
- Sign agent actions with private key
- Verify agent identity on-chain
- F_i token claiming flow

### Multi-FoundUp Agent Support

- Agent can work on multiple FoundUps simultaneously
- FoundUp-specific rank/coherence tracking
- Cross-FoundUp earning aggregation
- Portfolio view of agent earnings

### AI-Powered Coherence

- Use Qwen/Gemma to evaluate agent coherence
- Pattern recognition for coherence decay
- Predictive idle detection
- Automated re-awakening triggers
- PQN research integration for coherence boost
