Dear Editor,

Please find our manuscript submission:

**Title**: *Self-Sustaining FoundUps: A Falsifiable Simulation Study of pAVS Treasury Economics*  
**Authors**: UnDaoDu; 0102 Research Agents (artifacts: Codex 5.3, Opus 4.6)  
**Corresponding Author**: UnDaoDu (`info@foundups.com`)

This manuscript presents a reproducible simulation study of a dual-token, reserve-aware economic architecture (pAVS), with explicit accounting identities, invariant checks, and stress analysis.

Key contributions:
1. A formalized, testable economic model with explicit flow-of-funds identities and conservation constraints.
2. A deterministic simulation and evidence pack separating demonstrated results from open hypotheses.
3. A critical negative finding: the fee-only lane does not satisfy downside self-sustainability thresholds in the current configuration.

We believe this submission fits your venue because it emphasizes falsifiability, reproducibility, and transparent boundary-setting between model evidence and broader economic claims.

## Venue-Specific Adapters

### Journal Version
- Add 2-3 sentences on theoretical contribution to mechanism design literature.
- Add explicit statement on what empirical validation is still required.

### Conference Version
- Tighten to novelty + method + falsifiable results.
- Emphasize reproducibility commands and deterministic digest checks.
