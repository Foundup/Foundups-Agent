"""FoundUps Agent Swarm Simulator.

MECHANICAL MODEL:

TYPE (set at entry - simple):
  2 (Du) = You STARTED the project (Founder)
  1 (Dao) = You JOINED the project (Team Member)
  0 (Un) = You USE the product (Customer)

ACTIVITY (dynamic - based on WORK done by your digital twin):
  2 = Doing the most work (active)
  1 = Regular contribution
  0 = Agent stopped working → DEGRADED (project abandoned by you)

Key Insight: ENGAGEMENT determines reward, NOT title.
- Inactive Founder "20": 3.20% (accesses all pools, but 4% of each)
- Active Team Member "12": 60.80% (0+1 pools at 80% each)
- Active team member earns 19x more than inactive founder!

DEGRADATION (mechanical):
- No agent work for X epochs → Activity drops automatically
- Founder who abandons earns almost nothing

ELEVATION (governance):
- Digital twin observes work patterns
- Suggests: "Agent X should be upgraded to Founder"
- Current founder(s) approve → Type upgrade happens
- Both active founders share top tier rewards

SIMULATOR TESTS:
1. Activity degradation curve
2. Elevation threshold mechanics
3. Multi-founder reward splitting
4. Abandoned project scenarios
5. Pool math verification

    - People have difficulty getting rid of stuff (especially in Japan)
    - App lets you snap photo → AI prices → instant listing
    - Browse 50km radius for affordable used items

    Key model:
    - HUMANS (012) are founders/partners/customers with Type+Activity
    - AGENTS (0102) are equal swarm workers with specializations
    - Engagement determines reward, NOT title
