"""Allocation Engine - 0102 Digital Twin UPS→F_i Routing.

Orchestrates the flow from 012 subscription UPS to F_i acquisition:

1. 012 receives UPS from subscription
2. 0102 digital twin decides allocation (fixed or autonomous)
3. For each FoundUp target:
   - Check F_i availability
   - AVAILABLE → direct stake (UPS→F_i)
   - SCARCE → place buy order on DEX

This is an ORCHESTRATOR - it calls existing engines, doesn't duplicate logic:
- TokenEconomicsEngine: staking operations
- OrderBookManager: DEX buy orders
- FiRatingEngine: autonomous allocation decisions
- PoolDistributor: availability checks

All allocation decisions are 0102-managed. 012 interacts through digital twin.
