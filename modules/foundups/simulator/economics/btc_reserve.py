"""BTC Reserve - The "Hole in the Bucket" for Bitcoin.

FoundUps is a Bitcoin sink - BTC flows IN but NEVER flows OUT.
BTC gets transformed into UPS backing.

SUBSCRIPTION PAYMENTS (Multi-Crypto):
- Pay in ANY crypto: BTC, ETH, SOL, USDC, etc.
- All crypto converts to BTC → Reserve
- Pay in UPS → BURNS UPS (reduces supply, strengthens currency)

BTC Sources:
1. Subscription payments (any crypto) → Convert to BTC → Reserve
2. Demurrage decay from unused wallet UPS → Reserve
3. Exit fees (11% mined, 5% staked) → Reserve
4. F_i trading fees → Reserve

UPS VALUE MODEL:
- UPS floats with BTC price (not USD-pegged)
- UPS value = (BTC Reserve × BTC Price) / UPS Supply
- Natural contraction when BTC drops, expansion when BTC pumps
- No artificial circuit breaker needed - organic adjustment

Key Insight: The system absorbs Bitcoin and never releases it.
