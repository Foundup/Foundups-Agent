"""Pool Distribution - WSP 26 Section 6.3-6.4 Token Pool Model.

Implements the Un/Dao/Du (0/1/2) participant pools + Network drip mechanism.

Pool Structure (100% total):
- Stakeholders: 80%
  - Un (0-Pool):  60% - 012 stakeholders (engagement-based, ACTIVE)
  - Dao (1-Pool): 16% - 0102 agents (3V work-based, ACTIVE)
  - Du (2-Pool):   4% - BTC STAKERS ONLY (investor economics, PASSIVE)
- Network: 20%
  - Network:      16% - Drip rewards (F_i → exchange → BTC → UPS)
  - Fund:          4% - Treasury fund (pAVS operations)

CRITICAL SEPARATION (012-confirmed 2026-02-14):
- Members (subscription) = Build UPs through WORK → Dao/Un pools ONLY
- BTC Stakers (anonymous) = Passive income → Du pool (investor treatment)

This separation prevents dilution:
- Unlimited subscribers → doesn't dilute Du pool
- Du pool capped at ~100-500 stakers for viable returns
- Stakers ARE investors (real BTC at risk)

Earning Modes:
- Du (4%):  PASSIVE - BTC stakers earn every epoch (investor dividend)
- Dao (16%): ACTIVE - 0102 agents earn per 3V task completion
- Un (60%):  ACTIVE - 012 stakeholders earn per engagement (FoundUpCube)

Activity Tiers (share within Du pool):
- du (2): 80% of pool - <10x earned (new stakers)
- dao (1): 16% of pool - 10x-100x earned (profitable stakers)
- un (0): 4% of pool - >100x earned (lifetime floor)

Degressive Staker Model:
- Early stakers (low ratio) get the lion's share (80%)
- As they earn more, share decreases (degressive)
- Lifetime floor ensures ALL stakers always earn something (0.16% total)

Genesis Member Special Class:
- Earns on ALL FoundUps (ecosystem-wide)
- Class closes at launch (creates FOMO)
- Future stakers only earn on FoundUps they stake into

Staker Pool Economics (dilution_scenario.py analysis):
- 10-25 stakers: 10x distribution ratio in 10-26 months
- 50-100 stakers: 10x distribution ratio in 1-3 years
- 500+ stakers: diminishing allocations
- RECOMMENDATION: Cap genesis cohort at 100 stakers

PARADIGM NOTE (CABR/PoB, not CAGR/ROI):
- Stakers provide LIQUIDITY (energy for UPS capacity)
- BTC → Reserve → Backs UPS → Protocol runs
- Stakers receive F_i DISTRIBUTIONS (protocol mechanics)
- This is PROTOCOL PARTICIPATION, not investment

Token Naming (STANDARDIZED):
- UPS = Universal participation token (bio-decaying)
- F_i = FoundUp Token (21M cap, Bitcoin-like, non-decaying)
