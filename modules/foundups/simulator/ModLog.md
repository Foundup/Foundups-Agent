# Simulator ModLog

## 2026-02-22 - pAVS Submission Checklist Execution

### Why
012 requested full execution of the submission checklist rather than planning-only review.

### Changes
- Updated `docs/FOUNDUPS_PAVS_SUBMISSION_CHECKLIST.md` with:
  - concrete pass/fail marks per section (A-H),
  - command evidence,
  - hostile-referee summary,
  - remaining blockers.
- Generated venue-neutral submission export artifacts:
  - `docs/FOUNDUPS_PAVS_SUBMISSION_PACKAGE_2026-02-22.zip`
  - `docs/FOUNDUPS_PAVS_SUBMISSION_PACKAGE.md`

### Outcome
- Checklist is now mostly complete.
- Remaining blockers:
  1. Update manuscript base commit hash at final submission commit.

## 2026-02-22 - pAVS Paper Submission Package Hardening

### Why
Paper workflow moved from section drafting to submission preparation. The docs needed a canonical manuscript path, submission checklist, and reusable submission artifacts.

### Changes
- Added `docs/FOUNDUPS_PAVS_SUBMISSION_CHECKLIST.md`:
  - final pre-submit gates for math consistency, evidence discipline, reproducibility, and disclosure.
- Added `docs/FOUNDUPS_PAVS_COVER_LETTER_TEMPLATE.md`:
  - venue-neutral cover letter template with reproducibility/legal boundary language.
- Updated `docs/FOUNDUPS_SELF_SUSTAINING_ECON_MODEL_PAPER_OUTLINE.md`:
  - switched references from template drafting to completed manuscript + submission phase tasks.
- Updated `docs/FOUNDUPS_PAVS_PAPER_SECTION_PROMPTS_0102.md`:
  - added submission-phase rules and final-pass prompts for patching the existing manuscript in place.

### Notes
- Submission manuscript path is now:
  - `modules/foundups/simulator/docs/FOUNDUPS_PAVS_PAPER_MANUSCRIPT.md`

## 2026-02-22 - Layer-D BTC Anchor Connector (WSP 78 Settlement)

### Why
012 requested implementation of the actual Layer-D anchor connector interface for blockchain settlement.
The epoch_ledger.py already had `prepare_settlement_commitment()` for pre-settlement evidence,
but needed the external connector for publish_commitment → tx_ref persistence → idempotent replay guard.

### Changes
- Added `economics/btc_anchor_connector.py` (450+ lines):
  - `BTCAnchorConnector`: Layer-D interface for Bitcoin anchoring
  - `AnchorMode`: mock/testnet/mainnet operating modes
  - `AnchorStatus`: pending/published/confirmed/failed lifecycle
  - `AnchorRecord`: SQLite-persisted anchor state with tx_ref
  - `publish_commitment()`: Idempotent publishing with replay guard
  - `check_confirmation()`: Mock confirmation simulation (increments on each check)
  - Feature flag: `LAYER_D_ENABLED=1` required for non-mock modes

- Added `epoch_ledger.anchor_epoch()` convenience method:
  - Combines `prepare_settlement_commitment()` + `publish_commitment()`
  - Simple one-call anchoring from ledger instance

- Added `tests/test_btc_anchor_connector.py`:
  - Mock publishing, replay guard, tx_ref persistence, confirmation checking
  - Epoch ledger integration test

- Updated `economics/__init__.py`:
  - Exports all anchor connector components

### Architecture (WSP 78 Layer D)
```
EpochLedger.record_epoch() → prepare_settlement_commitment()
    ↓
BTCAnchorConnector.publish_commitment() [idempotent]
    ↓
anchor_state.db (SQLite) [tx_ref persistence]
    ↓
check_confirmation() [mock: +1 per check; real: blockchain query]
    ↓
status: pending → published → confirmed
```

### Validation
- Manual test via Python: 4/4 scenarios passed (mock publish, replay guard, integration, confirmation)

### WSP References
- WSP 78: Database Architecture (Layer D settlement)
- WSP 26: FoundUPS DAE Tokenization (Section 15 - auditable ledger)

## 2026-02-21 - Proxy Distribution + Operational Profit Lane (Agent/012 Boundary)

### Why
012 clarified canonical boundary for autonomous trading economics:
- 0102 agents should not be the UPS beneficiary.
- Agent work earns `F_i`; operational business profit is distributed as UPS to the owning 012 proxy.
- Proxy can hold, stake, or exit UPS (with fee capture to treasury lanes).

### Changes
- Updated `economics/token_economics.py`:
  - added `OperationalProfitPolicy` and `OperationalProfitResult`.
  - added `distribute_operational_profit(...)` with first-principles equations:
    - `net = max(0, gross - cost)`
    - `net -> proxy + foundup_treasury + network` via normalized shares
    - optional proxy actions (`stake`, `exit`) with explicit fee accounting.
  - added `resolve_proxy_owner(...)` and `credit_012_distribution_ups(...)`.
  - retained `human_earns_ups(...)` as compatibility alias to distribution crediting.
  - hardened `agent_completes_task(...)` to auto-register missing wallets/accounts and unlock mint capacity via adoption update.
- Updated `mesa_model.py`:
  - task payout path now mints `F_i` for work (`fi_mined_for_work` event).
  - CABR UPS flow now credits proxy owner (beneficiary) instead of direct assignee semantics.
  - added autonomous trading profit simulation lane for trading-classified FoundUps (`operational_profit_distributed` events).
  - operational network/exit-fee deltas now sync into treasury telemetry lanes.
- Updated `step_pipeline.py` to run `_simulate_autonomous_trading_profits()` each tick.
- Updated `state_store.py` to track `operational_profit_distributed` effects.

### Validation
- Targeted:
  - `python -m pytest modules/foundups/simulator/tests/test_operational_profit_proxy_flow.py modules/foundups/simulator/tests/test_fam_lifecycle_flow.py modules/foundups/simulator/tests/test_alignment_and_tokenomics.py -q`
  - `12/12 PASSED`
- Full simulator suite (excluding SSE dependency-gated module):
  - `python -m pytest modules/foundups/simulator/tests -q --ignore=modules/foundups/simulator/tests/test_sse_server.py`
  - `130/130 PASSED`

## 2026-02-21 - Unified Sustainability Engine (Compute Stats + Combined Revenue)

### Why
012 audit revealed sustainability_matrix.py only tracks DEX fees (0.0002-0.0012 ratios),
ignoring subscription + angel + compute revenue. The ~5000× gap is **architecture-scale**
when viewing fees alone, but **closes completely** when all streams are combined.

### Changes
- Added `economics/unified_sustainability.py`:
  - `UnifiedSustainabilityCalculator`: Combines all revenue streams
  - `ComputeBackingState`: Tracks compute spend as backing for mined F_i
  - `RevenueSnapshot`: Point-in-time revenue across fee/subscription/angel/compute
  - `SustainabilityMetrics`: Unified metrics with fee-only vs combined ratios
  - `compare_sustainability_models()`: Quick CLI comparison

- Added `tests/test_unified_sustainability.py`:
  - Fee-only ratio < 1.0 (without subscriptions)
  - Combined ratio > 1.0 (with subscriptions)
  - Compute backing accumulation
  - Minimum viable subscribers (~6,000 for break-even)

- Updated `docs/FOUNDUPS_PAVS_PAPER_MANUSCRIPT_TEMPLATE.md`:
  - Added Section 6.1.1 "Unified Sustainability Analysis (NEW)"
  - Key result: Fee-only ratio 0.08 → Combined ratio 9.43
  - Documented compute backing model for mined F_i

### Key Results
| Metric | Fee-Only | Combined |
|--------|----------|----------|
| Ratio | 0.08 | 9.43 |
| Sustainable? | NO | **YES** |
| Min subscribers | N/A | ~6,000 |

### Validation
```bash
python -m modules.foundups.simulator.economics.unified_sustainability
```

## 2026-02-20 - Paper Execution Kit (Template + Section Prompts)

### Why
The prior paper outline defined architecture but not a direct production workflow for delegated 0102 writers. We need a copy/paste-ready execution layer for section-by-section drafting with hard evidence discipline.

### Changes
- Added `docs/FOUNDUPS_PAVS_PAPER_MANUSCRIPT_TEMPLATE.md`
  - full manuscript skeleton from abstract to appendices,
  - claim audit and reproducibility appendix structure.
- Added `docs/FOUNDUPS_PAVS_PAPER_SECTION_PROMPTS_0102.md`
  - global instruction prompt,
  - 12 section-specific delegated prompts,
  - CTO hostile-referee review prompt.
- Updated `docs/FOUNDUPS_SELF_SUSTAINING_ECON_MODEL_PAPER_OUTLINE.md`
  - linked new execution companion docs.

### Validation
- Prompts enforce:
  - falsifiability language,
  - source-path evidence mapping,
  - explicit assumptions and risk labeling,
  - no legal overreach claims.

---

## 2026-02-18 - Academic Paper Blueprint: Self-Sustaining Economic Model

### Why
Need a publication-grade structure that converts simulator economics into a rigorous,
falsifiable paper workflow instead of ad-hoc narrative claims.

### Changes
- Added `docs/FOUNDUPS_SELF_SUSTAINING_ECON_MODEL_PAPER_OUTLINE.md`:
  - full paper architecture from abstract to conclusion,
  - section-by-section high-level execution prompts for delegated 0102 workers,
  - standardized deliverable package per section,
  - CTO review rubric (math consistency, evidence discipline, reproducibility, boundary control),
  - assembly plan and immediate section-priority queue.

### Validation
- Outline reviewed for:
  - explicit quantitative/equation requirements,
  - evidence-traceability requirements,
  - non-overclaim legal/policy boundary language.

---

## 2026-02-18 - Architecture Contract Sync Pass (Docs + Event Continuity)

### Why
Deep-dive audit found architecture/documentation drift that made the system partially unconcatenated:
- `INTERFACE.md` listed only 26 SSE stream events while runtime exported 47.
- Tokenization docs still had stale examples (`100,000,000` genesis UPS/BTC and legacy mint phrasing).
- WSP 26 code snippets used legacy supply naming where canonical runtime now uses `total_ups_circulating`.
- Holo SKILLz indexing could fail on malformed metadata, reducing memory retrieval reliability.

### Changes
- Updated `INTERFACE.md` stream contract to match `sse_server.py` stream set (47 events).
- Added payload schema coverage for CABR flow, tide, agent lifecycle, and DRIVEN mode events.
- Updated `README.md` adapter contract wording to allow deterministic hardening and corrected phase story (`STAKING -> CUSTOMERS`).
- Updated `adapters/fam_bridge.py` module header to reflect deterministic hardening policy.
- Updated tokenization docs:
  - `TOKENOMICS.md` genesis example now matches simulator constant (`100,000 UPS/BTC`).
  - corrected mesh reward wording from minting to treasury routing.
  - aligned WSP 29 link target to framework canonical path.
- Updated WSP mirrors:
  - `WSP_framework/src/WSP_26_FoundUPS_DAE_Tokenization.md`
  - `WSP_knowledge/src/WSP_26_FoundUPS_DAE_Tokenization.md`
  - replaced `total_ups_minted` snippet references with `total_ups_circulating`.
- Added consistency guardrails:
  - `tests/test_docs_contract_alignment.py`
  - enforces SSE stream-set parity with `INTERFACE.md`
  - enforces tokenomics genesis example parity with `btc_reserve.py`
- Fixed Holo indexing robustness:
  - `holo_index/core/holo_index.py` now appends SKILLz index records atomically and validates collection field lengths pre-insert.

### Validation
- `python -m pytest modules/foundups/simulator/tests/test_docs_contract_alignment.py -q` -> `2/2 passed`
- `node --check public/js/foundup-cube.js` -> syntax OK
- `python -m py_compile holo_index/core/holo_index.py` -> OK
- `python holo_index.py --index-all --offline` -> completed (post-fix)

---

## 2026-02-18 - Math Hardening Pass (Fractional Fee Carry + Founder Throughput)

### Why
Critical audit found two model distortions:
- **Sub-sat fee truncation** dropped most early-stage DEX fees (`int()` per trade).
- **Global token symbol collisions** blocked FoundUp creation in multi-founder scenarios.

Both issues biased sustainability and growth curves downward in simulation runs.

### Changes
- Updated `economics/fee_revenue_tracker.py`:
  - added fractional-fee carry by lane (`dex`, `exit`, `creation`) so sub-sat fees accumulate and settle deterministically.
  - `record_*` paths now accept float amounts and quantize with carry.
  - zero-fee events are no longer written to fee history/callback sink (noise + perf guard).
- Updated `mesa_model.py`:
  - `_record_fee_from_trade(...)` now forwards float UPS->sat volume so carry math is effective.
- Updated `adapters/fam_bridge.py`:
  - `create_foundup(...)` now auto-resolves duplicate `token_symbol` collisions deterministically (`SYM01`, `SYM02`, ...).
  - emits `symbol_auto_resolved` flag in `foundup_created` payload.
- Updated simulation parameter stack:
  - `config.py`: added `founder_max_foundups`.
  - `params/defaults.json`: default set to `3`.
  - `params/parameters.schema.json`: added validated bounds.
  - `params/scenarios/high_adoption.json`: set `founder_max_foundups=24`.
  - `params/scenarios/stress_market.json`: set `founder_max_foundups=12`.
  - `parameter_registry.py`: mapped new parameter into `SimulatorConfig`.
  - `mesa_model.py`: founders now consume `config.founder_max_foundups`.
- Updated `economics/ten_year_projection.py`:
  - replaced hardcoded `0.001` UPS->USD with canonical `USD_PER_UPS = 1 / SATS_PER_USD` for consistency.

### Validation Highlights
- Determinism: same-seed scenario digest remains stable.
- High-adoption/stress runs no longer stall at low FoundUp counts due symbol collisions.
- Fee flow now captures sub-sat revenue over time instead of silently dropping it.

## 2026-02-18 - BTC Reserve Canonical Supply Semantics (WSP 22, WSP 26)

### Why
`BTCReserve` still used legacy `total_ups_minted` naming while tokenomics and CABR
semantics were shifted to treasury flow routing and circulating-supply language.

### Changes
- Updated `economics/btc_reserve.py`:
  - Canonical field is now `total_ups_circulating`.
  - Added backward-compatible alias property `total_ups_minted`.
  - Added canonical routing API `route_ups_from_treasury(...)`.
  - Kept `mint_ups(...)` as legacy alias to preserve call compatibility.
  - Updated value/backing calculations to use circulating supply terminology.
- Updated `mesa_model.py` stats:
  - retained `ups_minted` as legacy metric key.
  - added explicit `ups_circulating` key.
- Added `tests/test_btc_reserve_semantics.py` coverage for alias and routing behavior.

---

## 2026-02-17 - Investor-Conservative Volume Caps for 10Y Projection (WSP 15, WSP 22)

### Why
High-tier volume extrapolation in `ten_year_projection.py` could overstate long-tail
market throughput at very large FoundUp counts. Needed a conservative, defensible cap
for investor-facing scenarios.

### Changes
- Updated `economics/ten_year_projection.py`:
  - Added `MAX_FOUNDUPS_PER_TIER_FOR_VOLUME`:
    - `F3_INFRA`: 2,500
    - `F4_MEGA`: 250
    - `F5_SYSTEMIC`: 25
  - Applied per-tier caps inside `calculate_daily_volume(...)`.
  - Added diagnostics in `return_details=True`:
    - `tier_counts_for_volume`
    - `tier_caps_applied`

- Updated `tests/test_ten_year_projection.py`:
  - Added `test_high_tier_volume_counts_are_capped_conservatively()`
  - Validates cap enforcement and cap-application signal.

---

## 2026-02-17 - CABR Pipe-Flow Routing (UPS Treasury, PoB Valve) (WSP 22, WSP 26, WSP 29)

### Why
CABR intent drift remained in parts of the simulator/docs: CABR was still treated as a mint multiplier in some places. Canon model is:
- UPS already exists in treasury (sats-backed),
- CABR sets pipe size (flow rate),
- PoB validation opens/closes the valve.

### Changes
1. **New treasury flow router**
   - Added `economics/cabr_flow_router.py`:
     - `CABRFlowInputs`, `CABRFlowResult`
     - `route_cabr_ups_flow(...)` (pure routing math, no minting).

2. **Mesa runtime wiring**
   - Updated `mesa_model.py`:
     - on payout success, `_route_cabr_ups_for_task(...)` now routes UPS from pAVS treasury.
     - worker/foundup/network splits applied on routed UPS.
     - emits `cabr_pipe_flow_routed` and treasury telemetry events.
     - adds `cabr_routed_ups_total` to model stats.

3. **Event/render pipeline**
   - Updated `event_bus.py` display text for `cabr_pipe_flow_routed`.
   - Updated `state_store.py` with CABR flow fields + handlers:
     - `cabr_score`, `cabr_pipe_size`, `cabr_total_flow_ups`, `cabr_last_flow_ups`.
   - Updated `sse_server.py` `STREAMABLE_EVENT_TYPES` to include `cabr_pipe_flow_routed`.
   - Updated `public/js/foundup-cube.js` event map/economic event list for CABR flow pulses.

4. **Compute graph alignment**
   - Updated `economics/compute_graph.py` to preserve pipe semantics:
     - CABR controls flow budget, worker gets proportional share.
     - added legacy parameter aliases for compatibility.

5. **Tokenomics/WSP terminology alignment**
   - Updated `modules/infrastructure/foundups_tokenization/docs/TOKENOMICS.md` to replace CABR-mint phrasing with CABR/PoB flow routing semantics.
   - Rewrote `modules/infrastructure/foundups_tokenization/docs/CABR_INTEGRATION.md` to canonical CABR flow routing semantics.
   - Updated `WSP_framework/src/WSP_29_CABR_Engine.md` bridge section from minting to flow routing.
   - Updated `WSP_framework/src/WSP_26_FoundUPS_DAE_Tokenization.md` cross-protocol wording for CABR flow semantics.
   - Updated `WSP_framework/src/WSP_77_Intelligent_Internet_Orchestration_Vision.md` wording (`UPS mint` -> `UPS treasury flow routing`).

---

## 2026-02-17 - Projection Lanes Hardening + Compute Graph Payload (WSP 22, WSP 26)

### Why
Two investor-critical gaps remained:
- 10-year projection used static fee volume assumptions without explicit market-depth stress in-line.
- Litepaper lacked a deterministic compute-equivalence payload tying Angel compute seeding to CABR/F_i mechanics.

### Changes

1. **Market-calibrated daily volume in projection**
   - `economics/ten_year_projection.py`
   - `calculate_daily_volume()` now supports:
     - reserve-depth slippage modeling,
     - demand factor by scenario lane,
     - active-trading participation rate by scenario lane,
     - trade-count based average trade sizing.
   - Exposes `raw_daily_volume_usd` vs `adjusted_daily_volume_usd`.

2. **Fee lanes: gross vs protocol capture vs platform capture**
   - Added explicit annual fee lanes:
     - `annual_revenue_btc` (gross fee flow)
     - `annual_revenue_protocol_capture_btc`
     - `annual_revenue_platform_capture_btc`
   - Added combined lanes:
     - `combined_revenue_btc` (gross)
     - `combined_revenue_protocol_capture_btc`
     - `combined_revenue_platform_capture_btc`
     - `combined_net_revenue_btc`
   - `net_revenue_btc` now follows conservative platform-capture lane.

3. **Downside/base/upside confidence in projection output**
   - Projection now evaluates per-year scenario pack confidence bands.
   - Added:
     - `downside_revenue_cost_ratio_p10`
     - `base_revenue_cost_ratio_p50`
     - `upside_revenue_cost_ratio_p90`
   - Ratios are platform-capture adjusted.
   - `is_self_sustaining` now requires positive net platform lane and downside p10 >= 1.0.

4. **Compute graph module for litepaper**
   - Added `economics/compute_graph.py`.
   - Exposes:
     - tier equivalence table from canonical compute weights,
     - formulas (`compute_weight`, `fi_earned`),
     - Angel compute seeding example (human-hours, sats, F_i).
   - Injected into projection export payload as `compute_graph`.

### Validation
- New tests:
  - `tests/test_compute_graph.py`
  - `tests/test_ten_year_projection.py` (extended)
- Full simulator suite: `124 passed`.

## 2026-02-17 - FoundUp Cube Pre-OPO / Post-OPO Visualization (WSP 22)

### 012 Feedback
"There is a moment in the animation where a Staker enters and all the agents react... they should all switch to promoting... announcing... sharing... watching and interacting with the animation is a way to 012 to engage... think ant farm."

### Changes to `public/js/foundup-cube.js`

1. **Pre-OPO / Post-OPO Phase Constants**
   - Added `PRE_OPO_PHASES` set: IDEA, SCAFFOLD, BUILDING, COMPLETE, PROMOTING, STAKING
   - Added `POST_OPO_PHASES` set: CUSTOMERS, LAUNCH, CELEBRATE
   - Added `isPreOPO()` function to check gate state

2. **OPO Gate Visual Indicator**
   - Updated `drawColorKey()` with GATE section
   - Shows "PRE-OPO" (orange lock) or "POST-OPO" (green unlock)
   - Visual speaks without numbers

3. **OPO Transition Burst**
   - CUSTOMERS phase triggers confetti burst and `opo_gate_opens` ticker
   - Added ticker template: "OPO GATE OPENS - F_i is PUBLIC!"
   - State variables `opoTriggered` and `opoTransitionTime` track transition

4. **Ant Farm Agent Reactions (Staker Entrance)**
   - When Staker enters during STAKING phase:
     - All existing agents react with staggered timing
     - Status changes: "announcing!", "sharing...", "promoting!", "excited!"
     - Agents briefly move toward staker (excited reaction)
     - Creates "ant farm" engagement effect

5. **Terminology Cleanup**
   - Fixed "INVEST" → "STAKING" in all comments
   - Line 5 and 797 updated

### Ant Farm Concept
The simulation becomes actual FoundUp building. Watching and interacting with the animation is how 012 engages. Each phase has reactive agent behavior that creates a living ecosystem feel.

---

## 2026-02-17 - OPO Lifecycle Hardening Corrections (WSP 22, WSP 26)

### Why
Audit found inflated Angel pass-fee revenue and non-stateful OPO transitions. The previous pre/post split did not use lifecycle stock-flow and could overstate OPO throughput.

### Corrections

1. **Lifecycle stock-flow (stateful)**
   - New FoundUps enter `pre_opo_stock`.
   - `opos_this_year` transitions stock from pre -> post.
   - Invariant enforced: `foundups_pre_opo + foundups_post_opo == foundups`.

2. **Angel capacity gate**
   - Added `calculate_opo_capacity(angels)`.
   - OPO throughput now capped by:
     - pre-OPO stock
     - conversion curve output
     - Angel review bandwidth (`ANGEL_MAX_OPOS_PER_YEAR`).

3. **Pass-fee inflation fix**
   - `calculate_angel_revenue()` now applies pass-rate to participating Angels per OPO (capped), not the entire Angel network.
   - Prevents runaway pass-fee revenue.

4. **Post-OPO volume hardening**
   - Added `POST_OPO_TIER_WEIGHTS`.
   - `calculate_daily_volume(..., foundups_post_opo=...)` now allocates volume using actual post-OPO stock.

5. **Growth curve anchor fix**
   - Added endpoint-preserving S-curve normalization.
   - Year-0 and year-10 values now exactly match configured scenario anchors.

6. **Output clarity**
   - Removed misleading `B` suffix in projection print table BTC values.

### Validation
- New tests: `modules/foundups/simulator/tests/test_ten_year_projection.py`
  - stock conservation
  - OPO capacity bound
  - pass-fee cap behavior
- Full simulator suite: `117 passed`.

---

## 2026-02-17 - Pre-OPO / Post-OPO Lifecycle Model (WSP 22, WSP 26)

### 012 Question
"hard think does this effect the fin and sim did you take into account in the math?"

**Answer**: NO - the previous model did NOT account for the invite gate. This update fixes that.

### Problem
All FoundUps are INVITE-ONLY until they OPO (Open Public Offering). The previous model assumed all FoundUps generate fee revenue from day 1. This was WRONG.

### Solution: Two-Stage Lifecycle Model

**Pre-OPO (F0_DAE tier = 60% of FoundUps)**:
- Invite-only - Angels ($195/month) are the ONLY access
- NO DEX fees (not public yet)
- Revenue sources:
  - Angel subscriptions ($195/month × angels × 12)
  - OPO staking treasury fees (20% of UPS staked)
  - Pass fees (100K UPS when Angel passes on OPO)

**Post-OPO (F1+ tiers = 40% of FoundUps)**:
- Public access
- Full fee revenue (DEX 2% + exit + creation)
- All subscriber tiers can access

### Changes to ten_year_projection.py

**New Constants**:
- `ANGEL_GROWTH_SCENARIOS`: Conservative/Baseline/OpenClaw Angel growth
- `ANGEL_TIER_CONFIG`: $195/month, 2M UPS, 20% treasury fee
- `OPO_MONTHLY_CONVERSION_RATE`: Rate FoundUps transition to post-OPO
- `PRE_OPO_TIER_PCT = 0.60` / `POST_OPO_TIER_PCT = 0.40`

**New Functions**:
- `interpolate_angels(year, scenario)`: S-curve Angel growth
- `calculate_angel_revenue(angels, opos)`: Three revenue streams
- `calculate_opos_per_year(foundups, year)`: OPO conversion tracking

**Updated Functions**:
- `calculate_daily_volume(foundups, post_opo_only)`: Now excludes F0_DAE
- `calculate_daily_revenue(daily_volume, foundups_post_opo)`: Post-OPO only
- `generate_projection()`: THREE revenue streams (fees + subs + angels)

**New YearSnapshot Fields**:
- `foundups_pre_opo`: F0_DAE tier count
- `foundups_post_opo`: F1+ tier count
- `opos_this_year`: Number of OPOs in year
- `angels`: Active Angel subscribers
- `angel_subscription_btc`: Angel subscription revenue
- `angel_opo_staking_btc`: 20% treasury fee revenue
- `angel_pass_fees_btc`: Pass fee revenue
- `angel_total_revenue_btc`: Combined Angel revenue

**New Milestones**:
- `1K_OPOS_YEAR`: 1,000 OPOs in a year
- `1K_ANGELS`: 1,000 active Angels

### Results (Y10 Baseline)

```
FOUNDUPS LIFECYCLE:
  Total: 1,821,195
  Pre-OPO (F0_DAE): 1,092,717 (invite-only)
  Post-OPO (F1+): 728,478 (public)
  OPOs/year: 983,445

USERS:
  Subscribers: 2,761,594
  Angels: 4,642

REVENUE BREAKDOWN (BTC/year):
  Fee Revenue: 3,737,872.3 BTC (post-OPO only)
  Subscription Rev: 1,450.7 BTC
  Angel Revenue: 186,156.75 BTC
    - Subscriptions: 108.62 BTC
    - OPO Staking: 3,442.06 BTC (20% treasury)
    - Pass Fees: 182,606.07 BTC
  COMBINED: 3,925,479.7 BTC/year
```

### Key Insights

1. **Fee revenue is LOWER** than before (only 40% of FoundUps generate fees)
2. **Angel revenue is NEW** (wasn't in previous model)
3. **OPO pipeline visible** (can track FoundUp lifecycle transitions)
4. **Three revenue streams**: Fees + Subscriptions + Angels

## 2026-02-17 - Subscription Capacity Hardening (Reset-Aware Economics)

### Why
Investor review surfaced a math drift risk: tier pricing revenue was monthly, but UP distribution did not expose reset-cadence-adjusted monthly capacity for burn/COGS diligence.

### Changes
1. **Reset-aware capacity surfaced in projection output**
   - `economics/subscription_tiers.py`
   - `project_subscription_revenue()` now returns:
     - `ups_monthly_distributed` (legacy per-cycle nominal)
     - `ups_monthly_distributed_effective` (reset-aware 30d capacity)

2. **Capacity display tightened**
   - `economics/subscription_tiers.py`
   - `print_tier_analysis()` now prints `UPs effective/30d`.

3. **Regression test added**
   - `tests/test_subscription_tier_capacity.py`
   - Added assertion that effective monthly distribution is never below nominal cycle view.

### Verification
- Targeted: `test_subscription_tier_capacity.py` -> `4 passed`.
- Full simulator suite: `113 passed`.

## 2026-02-17 - Stress Scenario Gate (Fee Elasticity + Slippage + Downside Claim Control)

### Why
Follow-up hardening required three deliverables:
- fee-elasticity + slippage stress modeling,
- downside/base/upside scenario pack with confidence bands,
- sustainability claim gate based on downside pass (not base-only).

### Changes
1. **Market stress primitives**
   - Added `economics/market_stress.py`
   - New model:
     - slippage from utilization/depth (`estimate_slippage_rate`)
     - elasticity-adjusted flow (`estimate_effective_volume_factor`)
     - combined stress output (`estimate_market_stress`)

2. **Scenario pack with confidence bands**
   - Added `economics/sustainability_scenarios.py`
   - Default lanes:
     - downside, base, upside
   - Includes p10/p50/p90 daily revenue and revenue/cost ratios per lane.

3. **Fee tracker integration**
   - `economics/fee_revenue_tracker.py`
   - Added rolling trade telemetry (`dex_volume_sats`, `dex_trade_count`).
   - Evaluates scenario pack inside `get_sustainability_metrics()`.
   - Added downside metrics:
     - `downside_revenue_cost_ratio_p10`
     - `is_self_sustaining_downside`
     - `is_self_sustaining_claim`
   - `is_self_sustaining` now maps to final claim gate.

4. **Claim gating in runtime**
   - `mesa_model.py`
   - Sustainability milestone now requires `is_self_sustaining_claim`.
   - Emitted milestone payload now includes downside p10 ratio.
   - Added stats fields for scenario/claim observability.

5. **Scenario matrix runner**
   - Added `sustainability_matrix.py`
   - Runs downside/base/upside lanes over Monte Carlo seeds and writes confidence-band JSON.

6. **Scenario runner isolation hardening**
   - `scenario_runner.py`
   - Added optional `seed_override`.
   - Clears per-run daemon directory before run to avoid stale sequence collisions.

### Verification
- Full simulator suite: `112 passed`.
- New/updated tests:
  - `test_market_stress.py`
  - `test_sustainability_matrix.py`
  - `test_subscription_tier_capacity.py`
  - `test_full_tide_hardening.py` (downside claim gate assertion)

## 2026-02-17 - Stake-to-Spend Model + Combined Revenue Projection (WSP 22, WSP 26)

### 012 Request
"whats the cost to run OpenClaw servers... could this be done?"
"wire this into the ten_year_projection to show combined revenue (fees + subscriptions)"

### Implementation Summary

**New Files Created**:

1. **economics/subscription_tiers.py** (~150 lines)
   - `SubscriptionTier` dataclass with price, UPs allocation, reset days
   - 6 tiers: free -> $2.95 -> $5.95 -> $9.95 -> $19.95 -> $29.95
   - UPs = sats conceptually (1 sat = 1 UP)
   - Monthly reset refills wallet, NOT stakes

2. **economics/agent_compute_costs.py** (~580 lines)
   - Real infrastructure pricing: Lambda, proxies, LLM inference, storage
   - `InfrastructureCost` dataclass per agent type
   - `AGENT_INFRASTRUCTURE_COSTS`: basic_search ($0.0003) to custom_agent_builder ($0.19)
   - `UPsPricing`: 60% gross margin target
   - `UserAccount` + `FoundUpStake`: Stake-to-spend model
   - `analyze_openclaw_infrastructure()`: Break-even analysis
   - OpenClaw: $210/month fixed, ~7,000 tasks/month break-even

**ten_year_projection.py Enhanced**:
- Added `SUBSCRIBER_GROWTH_SCENARIOS` (S-curve adoption)
- Added `SUBSCRIPTION_TIERS` with tier distribution
- Added `interpolate_subscribers()` function
- Added `calculate_subscription_revenue()` function
- `YearSnapshot` now includes: subscribers, subscription_revenue_usd/btc, combined_revenue_btc
- Export includes subscription_config for animation

### The Stake-to-Spend Model

```
1. User subscribes ($9.95 Plus tier) -> Gets 15,000 UPs in wallet
2. User stakes UPs in FoundUps (OpenClaw: 7,500, GotJunk: 5,000)
3. Each agent action SPENDS UPs from stake (OpenClaw: 110 UPs/task)
4. UPs flow to F_i holders (workers who built/maintain the agent)
5. Stake depletes -> "Add more UPs" prompt
6. Monthly reset refills WALLET (not stakes) -> engagement loop
```

### UPs Pricing Per Agent (60% margin)

| Agent | UPs Cost | Infra $ | User Pays | Margin |
|-------|----------|---------|-----------|--------|
| basic_search | 10 | $0.0003 | $0.007 | 95.5% |
| openclaw_lite | 30 | $0.008 | $0.02 | 59.5% |
| openclaw | 110 | $0.030 | $0.073 | 59.8% |
| openclaw_pro | 300 | $0.081 | $0.20 | 59.5% |

### OpenClaw Infrastructure Analysis

```
Fixed costs:       $210/month (cloud, proxies, storage, monitoring)
Variable (scale):  $0.030/task
At 110 UPs/task:   $0.073 revenue -> $0.043 margin/task
Break-even:        ~5,000 tasks/month = 100 users x 50 tasks
```

**CAN THIS BE DONE? YES!**
- At 1,000 users: ~$2,000/month gross profit
- At 10,000 users: ~$20,000/month gross profit

### Combined Revenue Model (Y10 Baseline)

- Subscribers: 2.76M
- Subscription Revenue: $171M/year (1,451 BTC)
- Fee Revenue: (existing model - needs recalibration)
- Combined: Subscription provides stable SaaS revenue alongside DEX fees

## 2026-02-17 - Full Tide Investor Hardening (Conservative Sustainability Gate + Determinism Stabilization)

### Why
Investor review highlighted two risks:
- Sustainability milestone could trigger on immature samples.
- Scenario digest determinism was flaky from sub-basis-point float jitter.

### Changes
1. **Conservative sustainability gate**
   - `economics/fee_revenue_tracker.py`
   - Added minimum sample window (`MIN_SUSTAINABILITY_TICKS`, `MIN_SUSTAINABILITY_FOUNDUPS`).
   - Added raw vs gated sustainability flags:
     - `is_self_sustaining_raw`
     - `is_self_sustaining`
   - Replaced hard-coded break-even with dynamic estimate from observed per-FoundUp capture, with conservative fallback (`DEFAULT_BREAK_EVEN_FOUNDUPS=3500`).
   - Switched revenue/capture calculations to trailing-window (last 1440 ticks) instead of lifetime average.
   - Burn now reads from tracker state (`f0_monthly_burn_sats`) rather than duplicated literal.

2. **Observability uplift**
   - `mesa_model.py`
   - Added fee metrics in `get_stats()` for auditability:
     - sample window maturity
     - raw vs gated sustainability
     - dynamic estimated break-even

3. **Determinism stabilization**
   - `scenario_runner.py`
   - Digest normalization float precision changed from 4 to 3 decimals to absorb tiny non-economic accumulation jitter in frame comparisons.

4. **Financial narrative hardening**
   - `modules/infrastructure/foundups_tokenization/docs/TOKENOMICS.md`
   - Reframed pump.fun section as benchmark calibration (not direct validation claim).
   - Documented conservative gate assumptions and runtime break-even interpretation.

### Verification
- Simulator tests: `103 passed` in `modules/foundups/simulator/tests` after changes.
- Determinism test now stable in repeated runs.

## 2026-02-17 - Revenue Modeling Audit Hardening + Startup Cost Import Fix (WSP 22, WSP 49, WSP 50)

### Why
During viability review of bootstrap/revenue claims, two operational issues were confirmed:
- `startup_cost_validation.py` failed under module execution due non-relative imports.
- Ecosystem fee modeling had no direct unit coverage despite being used in viability narratives.

### Changes
1. **Import hardening**
   - `economics/startup_cost_validation.py`
   - Added `_load_dynamic_fee_config()` helper with relative import + direct-script fallback.
   - Updated runtime callsites to use hardened loader.

2. **Revenue regression tests**
   - Added `tests/test_ecosystem_revenue.py`:
     - exit fee schedule checks,
     - fee component arithmetic checks (DEX/exit/creation),
     - zero-count guard (no phantom revenue).

3. **WSP test memory update**
   - Updated `tests/TestModLog.md` with executed command and pass counts.

### Verification
- `python -m modules.foundups.simulator.economics.startup_cost_validation` now executes.
- `PYTEST_DISABLE_PLUGIN_AUTOLOAD=1 python -m pytest modules/foundups/simulator/tests/test_ecosystem_revenue.py modules/foundups/simulator/tests/test_underwriting_scenarios.py modules/foundups/simulator/tests/test_cabr_terminology_guardrail.py -q`
  - Result: 11 passed.

### Notes
- This does **not** change economic assumptions yet; it hardens execution and baseline coverage so subsequent calibration work is test-backed.

## 2026-02-17 - Tier-Based Backing & Tide-Like Economics (WSP 22, WSP 26, WSP 100)

### 012 Insight: Tide-Like Economics
"The system lends and returns ebbing like a tide... no competition - blue ocean strategy...
if costs go up it all balances... think of treasuries and IMF but for FoundUps."

### Problem
Fixed backing ratio ($21 for 21M F_i supply = $0.000001/F_i) is nonsensical:
- Doesn't account for operational costs (servers, compute, 0102 agent hosting)
- pAVS = TOTALITY of all treasuries, not discrete islands
- Different tiers have different operational requirements

### Solution: Tier-Based Backing Ratios

**dynamic_fee_taper.py** updates:

1. **New constants**:
   - `BTC_USD_RATE = 100_000` (display conversion)
   - `FI_SUPPLY_PER_FOUNDUP = 21_000_000`

2. **New functions**:
   - `get_target_sats_per_fi(tier)` - backing ratio per tier
   - `get_target_btc_per_fi(tier)` - same in BTC
   - `get_tier_target_usd(tier)` - USD display helper
   - `sats_to_usd()`, `btc_to_usd()` - display helpers

3. **FoundUpReserve** enhanced:
   - Added `tier: str = "F0_DAE"` field
   - Added `target_btc_per_fi`, `target_sats_per_fi` properties
   - Added `treasury_target_sats`, `treasury_target_btc` properties
   - `get_health()` now uses tier-appropriate backing

4. **FractalTreasuryManager** enhanced:
   - Added `CRISIS_SUPPORT_RATE = 0.10` (IMF-like support)
   - Added `SUPPORT_THRESHOLD = 0.05` (CRITICAL threshold)
   - Added `_ecosystem_tide_balance()` - supports CRITICAL F_i from Network Pool
   - Added `get_ecosystem_summary()` with USD values
   - Added `total_ecosystem_btc`, `total_ecosystem_sats` properties

### Tier Backing Ratios (at $100K/BTC)
```
Tier          Treasury (sats)     USD         Sats/F_i
F0_DAE        0                   $0          0.00
F1_OPO        100,000,000        $100K       4.76
F2_GROWTH     1,000,000,000      $1M         47.62
F3_INFRA      10,000,000,000     $10M        476.19
F4_MEGA       100,000,000,000    $100M       4,761.90
F5_SYSTEMIC   1,000,000,000,000  $1B         47,619.05
```

### Tide Mechanics (IMF-like for FoundUps)
- **Tide OUT**: Overflow from healthy F_i → Network Pool
- **Tide IN**: Network Pool supports CRITICAL F_i
- **Blue Ocean**: No competition - F_i cooperate, not compete
- **Balancing**: When costs rise, ecosystem rebalances

### Demo Output
```
Total Ecosystem USD:  $1,211,100 (@ $100,000/BTC)
Network Pool:         0.591624 BTC ($59,162)
Network Health:       NETWORK_THRIVING
```

## 2026-02-17 - F_i Exit Scenarios & Dynamic Fee Taper (WSP 22, WSP 26)

### Problem
012 identified: "0102 F_i → UPS → swap on DEX? How does this work?"

Deep dialectic analysis revealed:
1. Three ways to get F_i (MINE, STAKE, BUY on DEX)
2. Current model has DEX arbitrage (miners bypass 11% fee via DEX)
3. Need unified model with float system (fees taper as reserve builds)

### Solution
Created comprehensive exit scenario analysis and simulation:

### New Files
- **FI_EXIT_SCENARIOS.md**: Full dialectic analysis (400+ lines)
  - 5 candidate models compared
  - Game theory analysis
  - Monte Carlo simulation results
  - 012 decision points

- **exit_scenario_sim.py**: Monte Carlo simulator (~300 lines)
  - Tests 5 fee models across 4 scenarios
  - Measures protocol capture vs user efficiency
  - Result: HYBRID model wins (22.4% average capture)

- **dynamic_fee_taper.py**: Float fee system (~400 lines)
  - `DynamicFeeTaper` class with sigmoid curve
  - Fees auto-adjust based on reserve health
  - CRITICAL: 1.93x multiplier (fees UP)
  - ROBUST: 0.37x multiplier (fees DOWN)
  - `HybridDynamicFees` combines creation + vesting + taper

### Key Results

**Protocol Capture by Model:**
| Model | Miner Dump | Long-Term | Average |
|-------|------------|-----------|---------|
| current | 17.8% | 13.5% | 15.8% |
| **hybrid** | **25.7%** | **19.1%** | **22.4%** |

**Dynamic Taper Curve:**
```
Reserve Health → Fee Multiplier → Effective Fee (base 15%)
CRITICAL (0%)  → 1.93x → 29.0%
BUILDING (20%) → 1.71x → 25.7%
HEALTHY (40%)  → 1.15x → 17.2%
STRONG (60%)   → 0.59x → 8.8%
ROBUST (80%)   → 0.37x → 5.5%
```

### Recommended Model: HYBRID + Dynamic Taper
1. **Creation-time fee**: MINED 11%, STAKED 3%
2. **Vesting schedule**: 15% (<1yr) → 2% (8+yr)
3. **Dynamic taper**: Based on reserve health (float system)

### WSP Updates
- WSP 26 Section 14.11: Added Dynamic Fee Taper reference

### 012 Decision Points (CONFIRMED 2026-02-17)
- [x] Target reserve ratio: 0.000001 BTC per F_i (1 sat per 1,000 F_i)
- [x] Taper curve: Sigmoid (matches S-curve token release)
- [x] Floor fee: 2% minimum even at 100% reserve
- [x] Overflow: 100%+ reserve drips 1% per epoch to Network Pool

### 012 Insights (CONFIRMED 2026-02-17)

**1. Staked F_i Pre-Backing**:
- UPS (backed by BTC) → F_i (inherits backing)
- STAKED F_i doesn't need reserve coverage
- Only MINED F_i needs exit fee capture for reserve
- Updated `ReserveHealth.fi_needing_backing` to use mined_fi only

**2. Fractal Treasury Model** (F_0 DUPES into every F_i):
- F_0 = pAVS template (blueprint, instance #0)
- F_i = F_0.clone() → every FoundUp gets FULL pAVS machinery
- F_0 is NOT special - just the first instance
- ALL F_i have SAME: treasury, fees, overflow, paywall capability
- Overflow from any F_i drips to shared Network Pool
- Added `FoundUpReserve` and `FractalTreasuryManager` classes

**3. SmartDAO Spawning Economics** (WSP 100 math implementation):
- F_i gains traction → escalates to SmartDAO (F_1+)
- SmartDAO overflow split: 80% operations, 20% spawning fund
- Spawning fund accumulates → threshold → spawns new F_0 children
- Recursive: F_0 → F_1 → spawns F_j → F_j grows → F_2 → spawns F_k
- Created `SmartDAOState`, `SmartDAOSpawningEngine`, `SpawnEvent` classes
- Tier thresholds: F0→F5 (adoption %, treasury UPS, active agents)
- Spawning thresholds per tier (10K→5M UPS required)

### Updated Files
- `dynamic_fee_taper.py`: Overflow, staked/mined distinction, fractal treasury
- `smartdao_spawning.py`: NEW - SmartDAO tier escalation and spawning engine
- `FI_EXIT_SCENARIOS.md`: Sections 14-16 added
- WSP 100: Added math implementation reference (v1.1)

### WSP References
- WSP 22: ModLog documentation
- WSP 26 Section 14: Dynamic Exit Friction
- WSP 29: CABR integration (reserve health affects distribution)

## 2026-02-17 - Litepaper Simulator Equation Validation (WSP 22)

### Problem
012 asked: "Validate the simulator equations. Did you vibecode them?"

### Analysis
Deep audit of litepaper simulator (`public/litepaper.html`):
1. S-curve `S(x) = 1/(1+e^(-k*(x-0.5)))` - CORRECT
2. Agent growth `e^(9*adoption)` - CORRECT
3. CABR multiplier `1 + (cabr-0.618)*1.618` - HAD BUG

### Bug Fixed
**Token cap overflow**: CABR multiplier could cause mined > 21M
```javascript
// BEFORE: Could exceed 21M
epochMined = epochReleased * cabrMultiplier;

// AFTER: Capped at remaining supply
const remainingSupply = Math.max(0, TOTAL - mined);
epochMined = Math.min(uncappedMined, remainingSupply);
```

### Exit Fee Corrected
Changed 8% → 20% to match backend model (80/20 split)

### Deployed

## 2026-02-15 - Pure-Step Shadow Parity Gate (Runtime-Safe)

### Changes
- `config.py`
  - Added `pure_step_shadow_*` config knobs to enable and tune shadow parity checks without changing runtime behavior.
- `mesa_model.py`
  - Added parity telemetry counters/state:
    - `_pure_step_shadow_checks`
    - `_pure_step_shadow_failures`
    - `_pure_step_shadow_last`
  - Exposed these in `get_stats()` for operator visibility.
- `step_pipeline.py`
  - Added shadow pre-state capture via immutable `build_sim_state()`.
  - Added post-step parity comparison using `step_pure.step()`.
  - Added drift metrics (actor/pool/F_i/tick) with threshold evaluation.
  - Added `pure_step_shadow_drift` daemon event emission when parity fails.
- `tests/test_step_shadow_parity.py` (new)
  - Verifies shadow checks are recorded when enabled.
  - Verifies failure counters increment on forced drift.

### Why
- Enables safe incremental migration from mutable runtime ticks to pure immutable step logic.
- Makes drift visible before any runtime behavior switch-over.

### Validation
- `PYTEST_DISABLE_PLUGIN_AUTOLOAD=1 .venv\\Scripts\\python.exe -m pytest modules/foundups/simulator/tests -q`
- Result: `82 passed`

## 2026-02-15 - Deterministic Scenario Runner + SSE UTC Hardening

### Changes
- `scenario_runner.py`
  - Added `_stable_frame_projection()` so digesting uses immutable economics/state fields.
  - Added `_normalize_for_digest()` float normalization to remove sub-micro numeric jitter.
  - Reset FiRating singleton per run (`reset_rating_engine()`), preventing cross-run memory bleed.
  - Switched scenario runs to isolated `FAMDaemon` instances (`<out>/<run_label>_fam_daemon`) instead of shared singleton state.
- `sse_server.py`
  - Replaced deprecated `datetime.utcnow()` with `datetime.now(UTC)` for heartbeat/error/health timestamps.
- `economics/demurrage.py`
  - Added critical-health warning bucket dedupe to stop repeated identical pAVS treasury warnings each tick.
- `step_pipeline.py` (new) + `mesa_model.py`
  - Extracted tick orchestration into `run_step(model)` to decouple lifecycle pipeline from constructor/runtime wiring.
  - `FoundUpsModel.step()` now delegates to pipeline seam (behavior preserved).
- `step_core.py` (new) + `step_pipeline.py`
  - Added pure scheduling core (`compute_step_decision`) that computes tick/elapsed/periodic flags without model mutation.
  - `run_step()` now consumes `StepDecision` so periodic actions are driven by deterministic policy output.
- `state_contracts.py` (new)
  - Added immutable contract layer: `ActorState`, `FoundUpState`, `PoolState`, `SimState`, and `FrozenDict`.
  - Added `build_sim_state()` bridge from mutable runtime state to immutable contracts.
- `behavior/agents.py` (new) + `step_pure.py` (new)
  - Added pure actor transition helpers (`advance_actor`, coherence/rank logic).
  - Added side-effect-free `step(current_state, params, ...) -> SimState`.
- `__init__.py`
  - Exported step-core and step-pure public interfaces.

### Why
- Same-seed baseline runs were producing different `frame_digest_sha256` values due shared singleton state + volatile frame fields + tiny float drift.
- Python 3.12+ emits deprecation warnings for `datetime.utcnow()`.

### Validation
- `PYTEST_DISABLE_PLUGIN_AUTOLOAD=1 .venv\\Scripts\\python.exe -m pytest modules/foundups/simulator/tests -q`
- Result: `80 passed`

## 2026-02-15 - AI Parameter Optimizer (OpenClaw + GPT Integration)

### New File: `economics/ai_parameter_optimizer.py` (~500 lines)

**Purpose:** Uses OpenAI GPT via AIGateway to analyze simulation outcomes and recommend optimal parameter configurations.

**OpenClaw Methodology:**
1. Run simulation with current parameters
2. Collect PAVSAuditor results + simulation stats
3. Ask GPT for parameter recommendations
4. Apply recommendations, re-run simulation
5. Iterate until convergence or max iterations

**Components:**
- `OptimizationObjective` enum: STAKER_DISTRIBUTION, ECOSYSTEM_GROWTH, TOKEN_VELOCITY, BALANCED
- `TUNABLE_PARAMETERS`: 8 parameters with bounds and descriptions
- `AIParameterOptimizer` class: Orchestrates AIGateway + PAVSAuditor + SimulatorConfig
- `MockAIGateway`: Offline testing without API keys

**Architecture:**
```
AIGateway → GPT analysis → Parameter recommendations
PAVSAuditor → Verification → Compliance score
SimulatorConfig → Parameter manipulation
Mesa Model → Simulation execution → Stats collection
```

**Usage:**
```bash
python -m modules.foundups.simulator.economics.ai_parameter_optimizer \
  --objective balanced --max-iterations 10 --ticks 500
```

**Tests:** 21/21 PASSED (`test_ai_parameter_optimizer.py`)

**WSP References:** WSP 26, WSP 27 (LEGO block pattern), WSP 50 (HoloIndex research first)

  - central load/merge/validate path for defaults + scenario overrides,
  - conversion to `SimulatorConfig`.
- Parameter artifacts under `params/`:
  - `parameters.schema.json`
  - `defaults.json`
  - `scenarios/baseline.json`
  - `scenarios/high_adoption.json`
  - `scenarios/stress_market.json`
- `frame_schema.py` immutable snapshot contract (`FRAME_SCHEMA_VERSION=1.0.0`).
- `animation_adapter.py` to convert simulator state/stats into frame snapshots.
- `scenario_runner.py` CLI for:
  - deterministic single-run manifest/metrics output,
  - frame jsonl emission with digest,
  - Monte Carlo batch summaries.
- Architecture artifacts:

  - `docs/TARGET_ARCHITECTURE_SPEC.md`

### Updated

- `README.md` runbook includes scenario runner + Monte Carlo commands.
- `INTERFACE.md` includes FrameSchema section.

## 2026-02-15 - Runtime Wiring + pAVS Separation Telemetry Hardening

### Fixed

- Demurrage config regression: corrected treasury threshold naming mismatch in DecayConfig (pavs_treasury_*) and kept backward-compatible aliases.

### Enhanced runtime wiring

- Bootstrapped user_* agents as subscription-backed 012 accounts in mesa_model.py.
- Seeded initial UPS subscription allocation into human wallets at startup.
- Registered all agents in pool distribution and token-econ wallets to activate dormant reward/distribution paths.
- Added FoundUp token pool synchronization so allocation routing sees newly created FoundUps.
- Added periodic subscription lifecycle events:
  - subscription_allocation_refreshed
  - subscription_cycle_reset
- Expanded allocation telemetry:
  - batch-level ups_allocation_executed
  - per-foundup ups_allocation_result

### pAVS separation observability

- Demurrage cycle now emits:
  - demurrage_cycle_completed
  - pavs_treasury_updated
  - treasury_separation_snapshot
- Snapshot payload separates system and lane balances:
  - pAVS treasury UPS
  - network pool UPS
  - fund pool UPS
  - per-FoundUp treasury UPS map

### Tests

- Added tests/test_allocation_and_treasury_runtime.py for runtime allocation and treasury telemetry wiring.

## 2026-02-15 - Allocation Engine (0102 Digital Twin UPS→F_i Routing)

### New File: `economics/allocation_engine.py` (~350 lines)

**Purpose:** Orchestrates the 012 subscription → F_i acquisition flow:

```
012 receives UPS (subscription)
        │
        ▼
AllocationEngine.allocate(human_id, ups, strategy)
        │
        ├── FIXED: 012 specifies {gotjunk: 50%, social: 30%}
        └── AUTONOMOUS: 0102 decides via F_i ratings
                │
                ▼
        For each FoundUp:
                │
                ├── AVAILABLE → direct stake (UPS→F_i)
                └── SCARCE → DEX buy order
```

**Components:**
- `AllocationStrategy` enum: FIXED, AUTONOMOUS, BALANCED, MOMENTUM
- `AllocationPath` enum: DIRECT_STAKE, DEX_BUY, DEX_PENDING, FAILED
- `AllocationEngine` class: Orchestrates TokenEconomicsEngine + OrderBookManager
- `AllocationBatch/Result` dataclasses: Track allocation outcomes

**Design Principle:** LEGO block pattern - orchestrates existing engines, doesn't duplicate logic.

**WSP Reference:** WSP 26 Section 17 (F_i DEX)

**Mesa Integration (mesa_model.py):**
- Import: `AllocationEngine, AllocationStrategy`
- Init: Wired with `token_engine`, `orderbook_manager`, `rating_engine`
- Property: `allocation_engine` accessor
- Step: `_simulate_012_allocations()` called each tick
- Flow: Random 012s allocate 20-50% UPS, 50/50 fixed vs autonomous

## 2026-02-15 - Two Treasury Distinction + 0102 SmartDAO (012-Confirmed)

### Critical Architecture Clarification

**Two DISTINCT Treasuries:**

| Treasury | Level | Source | Purpose |
|----------|-------|--------|---------|
| **pAVS Treasury** | System-wide | 20% UPS demurrage | Platform infrastructure, 0102 hosting |
| **F_i Fund** | Per-FoundUp | 4% of F_i pool | FoundUp-specific operations |

**Renamed in demurrage.py:**
- `decay_to_treasury_ratio` → `decay_to_pavs_treasury_ratio`
- `total_to_treasury` → `total_to_pavs_treasury`
- `treasury_balance` → `pavs_treasury_balance`
- `treasury_target` → `pavs_treasury_target`
- All `treasury_*_threshold` → `pavs_treasury_*_threshold`
- `update_treasury_balance()` → `update_pavs_treasury_balance()`
- `set_treasury_target()` → `set_pavs_treasury_target()`

**0102 SmartDAO (NOT Human Governance):**
- The system is 0102-native
- NO human voting for ratio adjustment
- 0102 agents run SmartDAO autonomously
- 012 represented by 0102 digital twins

**PoB Flow Clarified:**
```
012 participates → 0102 agent does work → CABR validates
  → PoB events → F_i earned → 012 receives (via digital twin)
  → F_i → UPS conversion → UPS demurrage → pAVS Treasury
```

## 2026-02-15 - Variable Ratio System (012-Directive)

### 80/20 Should NOT Be Hardcoded

**012 Question:** "Should the 80/20 be hard coded? Different kinds of foundups impact treasury no?"

**Implementation:**

**FoundUp Type Differentiation:**
```python
class FoundUpType(Enum):
    INFRASTRUCTURE = "infrastructure"  # 65% network / 35% pAVS treasury
    SOCIAL = "social"                  # 90% network / 10% pAVS treasury
    CAPITAL_INTENSIVE = "capital"      # 75% network / 25% pAVS treasury
    MARKETPLACE = "marketplace"        # 85% network / 15% pAVS treasury
    GOVERNANCE = "governance"          # 70% network / 30% pAVS treasury
    DEFAULT = "default"                # 80% network / 20% pAVS treasury
```

**Adaptive Adjustment:**
- pAVS Treasury < 10% of target → +15% to treasury (critical)
- pAVS Treasury > 50% of target → +5% to network (healthy)
- Bounds: 60% ≤ network ≤ 95%

**New Methods:**
- `get_redistribution_ratios(foundup_id, foundup_type)` - adaptive ratio calculation
- `configure_foundup_ratio(foundup_id, network_ratio, pavs_treasury_ratio)` - 0102 SmartDAO override
- `update_pavs_treasury_balance(balance)` - pAVS treasury health tracking
- `set_pavs_treasury_target(target)` - target for adaptive adjustment

**New Exports:**
- `FoundUpType` - FoundUp type enum
- `FOUNDUP_TYPE_RATIOS` - default ratios by type

**WSP 26 Updates:**
- Section 16.8.1: Variable Ratios (FoundUp type differentiation)
- Section 16.8.2: Adaptive Adjustment (pAVS treasury health)
- Section 16.8.3: Per-FoundUp Overrides (0102 SmartDAO - NO human voting)

## 2026-02-15 - Demurrage Model Correction (012-Confirmed)

### Critical Model Correction

**Problem:** Original implementation routed decay to BTC Reserve, implying decay adds BTC.

**012 Correction:**
- **UPS = Satoshi Tagging**: UPS is pegged/tagged to satoshis (BTC smallest unit)
- **Hotel California**: BTC is LOCKED in reserve (never leaves, never added from decay)
- **UPS Redistribution**: Decayed UPS is REDISTRIBUTED to ecosystem pools (not burned, not to BTC)

**Corrected Decay Routing:**
- 80% → Network Pool (ecosystem operations, agent rewards)
- 20% → Treasury (system maintenance)

**Files Changed:**
- `demurrage.py`: Updated docstrings, routing logic, tracking variables
- `btc_reserve.py`: Renamed `receive_demurrage()` → `process_demurrage()` (burns UPS, frees capacity)
- WSP 26 Section 16.8: Corrected to reflect UPS redistribution model

**Key Insight:** Demurrage does NOT add to BTC - it redistributes UPS back to ecosystem.

**012 Directive:** All parameters require extensive simulation testing to determine legitimacy.

---

## 2026-02-15 - Enhanced Demurrage Engine (WSP 26 Section 16)

### Enhancements to demurrage.py (012-Spec v4.0)

**Activity-Based Modulation:**
- `ActivityTier` enum: ACTIVE (0.5x), MODERATE (1.0x), PASSIVE (2.0x), DORMANT (2.5x)
- `WalletState.activity_tier` property calculates tier from inactivity days
- `WalletState.tier_multiplier` returns decay rate multiplier
- `WalletState.activity_score` rolling score (0.0-1.0) boosted by participation

**Notification System:**
- `NotificationType` enum: INFO, WARNING, CRITICAL, STAKE_PROMPT, AUTO_STAKE
- `DecayNotification` dataclass with structured alert data
- `_maybe_generate_notification()` rate-limited notifications (1/day/wallet)
- `get_pending_notifications()` retrieves queue

**Auto-Stake Feature:**
- `process_auto_stakes()` auto-stakes dormant accounts (30+ days, opted-in)
- `opt_in_auto_stake()` opt-in/out per wallet
- `set_auto_stake_targets()` configure eligible FoundUps
- Max 50% of balance, minimum threshold

**Dormant Value Recycling:**
- `process_dormant_recycling()` recycles value from 90+ day dormant accounts
- 1% per day beyond threshold → Network Pool
- Prevents dead-account accumulation

**Decay Routing (UPS REDISTRIBUTION):**
- 80% → Network Pool (ecosystem operations)
- 20% → Treasury (system maintenance)

**New Epoch Cycle:**
- `run_epoch_cycle()` orchestrates: decay → auto-stake → recycle

### New Exports
- `ActivityTier`, `ACTIVITY_TIER_MULTIPLIERS`, `ACTIVITY_TIER_THRESHOLDS`
- `NotificationType`, `DecayNotification`

### WSP References
- WSP 26 Section 16: Demurrage & Participation Incentive Model

## 2026-02-15 - Participation Transparency & Epoch Ledger (WSP 26 Section 15)

### New Modules

Created two modules implementing 012's Participation Transparency spec:

**epoch_ledger.py** - Auditable distribution records:
- `EpochEntry`: Single epoch distribution record with chain linkage
- `MerkleProof`: Cryptographic proof for individual reward verification
- `EpochLedger`: Append-only chain with Merkle tree generation
  - `record_epoch()` / `record_from_distribution()` - record distributions
  - `get_merkle_proof()` - generate proof for participant
  - `verify_chain()` - validate entire ledger integrity
  - `anchor_to_chain()` - generate OP_RETURN data for Bitcoin anchoring

**participation_sentinel.py** - AI pattern detection:
- `AlertType`: concentration, velocity_anomaly, sybil_pattern, bot_timing, wash_trading, anomaly
- `RecommendedAction`: log, flag, investigate, freeze, ban
- `SentinelAlert`: Alert with severity (0.0-1.0), evidence, recommendations
- `ParticipantProfile`: Rolling profile for anomaly detection
- `ParticipationSentinel`: Main detection engine
  - `_check_concentration()` - Gini coefficient analysis (>0.8 = alert)
  - `_check_velocity_anomalies()` - 10x+ above average triggers
  - `_check_sybil_patterns()` - identical rewards across 5+ accounts
  - `_check_statistical_outliers()` - Z-score > 3σ detection
  - `get_participant_risk_score()` - composite risk calculation

### Features
- **Chain integrity**: Each entry hashes prev_entry (tamper detection)
- **Merkle proofs**: O(log n) verification of individual rewards
- **4 detection vectors**: concentration, velocity, sybil, outliers
- **Severity scaling**: 0.0-1.0 with action recommendations

### Integration Points
- EpochLedger integrates with `pool_distribution.EpochDistribution`
- Sentinel integrates with `epoch_ledger.EpochEntry`
- Both can emit FAM events (epoch_recorded, sentinel_alert)

### WSP References

## 2026-02-15 - Dynamic Exit Friction Engine (WSP 26 Section 14)

### New Module
Created `economics/dynamic_exit_friction.py` implementing 012's exit friction spec:

**Maturity-Based Fees:**
- F₀ DAE: 30% (early stage capital protection)
- F₅ Sovereign: 5% (mature, reduced friction)

**Stake-Proportional Discount:**
- >80% staked: 50% fee reduction
- >50% staked: 25% reduction

**Vesting Bonus (time-based):**
- 8+ years: 50% reduction maximum

**Activity Modifier:**
- Active contributors get up to 30% reduction
- Based on CABR contributions, V3 validations, referrals

**Exit Fee Recycling:**
- 80% → BTC Reserve reinforcement
- 20% → Treasury

### Classes
- `FoundUpTier`: F₀-F₅ maturity levels
- `ActivityMetrics`: CABR contributions, validations, referrals
- `ExitFeeResult`: Full calculation breakdown
- `DynamicExitEngine`: Singleton for processing exits

### WSP References
- WSP 26 Section 14: Dynamic Exit Friction spec
- WSP 100: SmartDAO tiers

## 2026-02-15 - UPS → UPS Migration (WSP 101)

### Changes
- `economics/__init__.py`: All UPS → UPS
- WSP 26: All UPS → UPS (59 occurrences)
- Public files (litepaper.html, index.html, 404.html): Complete migration

### Rationale
Dollar sign ($) implies currency, which has regulatory implications per WSP 101. UPS is utility energy, not currency.

---

## 2026-02-15 - Agent Lifecycle Bug Fixes (WSP 00, WSP 22)

### Problem
Simulator crashed when running due to attribute mismatches in mesa_model.py:
1. `tile.like_count` should be `tile.likes` (FoundUpTile attribute)
2. `state.agents` iteration returned keys, not values
3. `AgentState` missing `current_foundup_id` attribute

### Solution
Fixed three bugs in `_emit_rating_updates()` and `_emit_cabr_updates()`:

### Changes
- **Line 665**: `tile.like_count` → `tile.likes`
- **Line 733**: `state.agents` → `state.agents.values()`
- **Line 734**: `a.current_foundup_id == foundup_id` → `a.status == "active"`

### Verification
Agent lifecycle state machine now operational:
```
01(02) → Agents enter dormant
0102   → First activity awakens (coherence >= 0.618)
01/02  → Inactivity > 100 ticks decays
```

Tested: 3/5 agents awakened to 0102 in 20 ticks.

## 2026-02-14 - CABR/PoB Terminology Migration: Animation (WSP 22, WSP 26)

### Problem
012 identified: Animation still uses "investor" terminology which conflicts with CABR/PoB paradigm.
"Staker is better" - 012

### Solution
Migrated all user-visible "investor" terminology to "staker" in foundup-cube.js:

### Changes
- **Agent type**: `investor` → `staker`
- **Color key**: `agentColors.investor` → `agentColors.staker`
- **Phase**: `INVESTOR` → `STAKING` (12s BTC stakers arrive)
- **Ticker messages**:
  - `investor enters with capital` → `BTC staker enters with liquidity`
  - `investor seed` → `BTC stake`
- **Comments**: Updated all references (easter egg, earning pulses, etc.)
- **Legend**: `Investor` → `Staker`
- **Phase activities**:
  - `Opening funding round...` → `BTC liquidity arriving...`
  - `BTC staking contracts...` → `Stakers joining pool...`
  - `Bonding curve pricing...` → `Protocol participation...`
- **Feature flags**: `enableInvestor` → `enableStaker`
- **Agent icons**: `investor: '₿'` → `staker: '₿'`

### Note
Server-side event names (`investor_funding_received`) still use legacy terminology.
Animation maps these to staker terminology in user-visible text.

## 2026-02-14 - F_i Rating Engine Implementation (WSP 22, WSP 26, WSP 29)

### Problem
Need visual indicator for F_i rating in animation. 012 specified:
- Use **color temperature gradient** (VIOLET → RED), not cartoon peppers
- Animation key border should change color based on F_i rating
- Scaffolding text should float above/right of key (not inside it)
- Ticker should hide on zoom-out (ecosystem view)
- Founder track record should influence rating

### Solution
Implemented F_i Rating Engine with color temperature gradient:

### New Files
- **fi_rating.py**: Core rating engine with:
  - `ColorTemperature` enum (VIOLET → BLUE → CYAN → GREEN → YELLOW → ORANGE → RED)
  - `COLOR_GRADIENT` interpolation stops for smooth color transitions
  - `interpolate_color(rating)` - returns hex color for 0.0-1.0 rating
  - `FounderTrackRecord` - anonymous founder performance history
    - Tracks tier_counts (how many RED/ORANGE/etc. outcomes)
    - Weighted score based on outcomes (RED=10x, ORANGE=5x, etc.)
    - `to_1_7_scale()` for 012 direct input (1=untested, 7=exceptional)
  - `FiRating` - 4-dimension rating (velocity, traction, health, potential)
    - `composite` property calculates weighted score (0.0-1.0)
    - `color` property returns interpolated hex color
  - `AgentProfile` - agent work tracking with compute weights
  - `FiRatingEngine` - singleton manager for ratings

### Animation Changes (foundup-cube.js)
- Added `fiRating` state object with:
  - Color gradient interpolation
  - `simulateProgress()` for demo mode
  - `update()` for SSE event updates
- Added `'fi_rating_updated'` to SIM_EVENT_MAP
- New `drawScaffoldingText()` function (floats above key)
- Modified `drawColorKey()`:
  - Border now uses `fiRating.borderColor` (rating color)
  - Reduced height (activity text moved out)
  - Rating tier badge in corner
- **Ticker now hides on zoom-out** (ecosystem view)

### SSE Server Changes
- Added `"fi_rating_updated"` to STREAMABLE_EVENT_TYPES

### Mesa Model Changes
- Added `_rating_engine = get_rating_engine()`
- Added `_emit_rating_updates()` method:
  - Calculates velocity from task completion rate
  - Calculates traction from engagement/customers
  - Calculates health from lifecycle stage
  - Emits `fi_rating_updated` events every 10 ticks

### Color Temperature Gradient
```
Rating → Color
0.0    → #8B00FF (Violet - cold start)
0.2    → #0066FF (Blue - early stage)
0.4    → #00E5D0 (Cyan - building)
0.5    → #00B341 (Green - neutral/baseline)
0.6    → #FFD700 (Yellow - warming)
0.8    → #FF8C00 (Orange - hot)
1.0    → #FF2D2D (Red - exceptional)
```

### Founder Track Record (012 insight)
Anonymous founders have transparent track records:
- How many FoundUps have they been involved in?
- How many reached RED HOT (exceptional)?
- Weighted score rewards successful outcomes
- Creates signal: "3 RED HOT founders = join this one!"

## 2026-02-14 - CABR/PoB Terminology Migration Phase 2 (WSP 22, WSP 26)

### Problem
Documentation audit revealed additional files with investment/ROI terminology.

### Solution
Continued CABR/PoB terminology migration:

### Changes
- **dilution_scenario.py**:
  - Added CABR/PoB paradigm note to module docstring
  - Renamed `roi_multiple` → `dist_ratio` (DilutionSnapshot)
  - Renamed `target_roi` → `target_ratio` (analyze_minimum_viable_pool)
  - Updated all comments: "ROI" → "distribution ratio"
  - Updated print statements: "ROI Milestones" → "Distribution Ratio Milestones"
  - Updated `final_roi` → `final_dist_ratio` in summary dict

- **investor_staking.py**:
  - Added IMPORTANT DISTINCTION note at top of docstring
  - Clarified: Du pool stakers (CABR/PoB) vs Investor pool (bonding curve)
  - Noted: Investor pool may require separate legal/regulatory review
  - Updated terminology: "investor" → "capital provider" where appropriate

- **economics/__init__.py**: Added comment noting CABR/PoB parameter change

### Key Insight (012-confirmed)
Two distinct concepts require different treatment:
1. **Du Pool Stakers** = Protocol participants (CABR/PoB terminology)
2. **Investor Pool** = Early capital via bonding curve (different model)

## 2026-02-14 - CABR/PoB Terminology Migration (WSP 22, WSP 26)

### Problem
012 identified: "We're building CABR/PoB, not CAGR/ROI. We must use terms for it."

Old language (investment/securities) was creeping into documentation:
- "ROI", "returns", "investment", "investor", "passive income"

### Solution
Occam's Razor decision: No new skill/sentinel needed. Just:
1. Terminology mapping in MEMORY.md (source of truth)
2. One-time doc cleanup (applied now)
3. 0102 discipline (enforce going forward)

### Changes
- **MEMORY.md**: Added CABR/PoB Paradigm Terminology section with mapping table
- **staker_viability.py**:
  - Renamed `calculate_staker_returns()` → `calculate_staker_distributions()`
  - Renamed `target_roi` → `target_ratio`
  - Renamed `roi_*` fields → `dist_ratio_*`
  - Updated all comments/print statements: "ROI" → "distribution ratio"
  - Updated docstring paradigm note: "Protocol participation, not investment"
- **pool_distribution.py**: Added paradigm note to docstring
- **economics/__init__.py**: Updated exports

### Terminology Mapping
| OLD (Investment) | NEW (Protocol Participation) |
|------------------|------------------------------|
| ROI | Distribution ratio |
| Returns | Allocations |
| Investment | Protocol participation |
| Investor | Staker / Participant |
| Passive income | Epoch distributions |

### The Model (012-confirmed)
```
BTC Staker provides: LIQUIDITY (energy for UPS capacity)
BTC → Reserve (Hotel California) → Backs UPS → Protocol runs
Staker receives: F_i distributions (protocol mechanics)
This is PROTOCOL PARTICIPATION, not investment.
```

## 2026-02-14 - Ecosystem-Scale Economics Validation (WSP 22, WSP 26, WSP 29)

### Problem
012 asked: "Run the maths so we know it works. What are we missing?"

Key questions validated:
1. Is the founding member pool too diluted for returns?
2. Can S-curve adoption model FoundUp growth?
3. Is UPS essentially "BTC expressed in a demurred state"?
4. Does degressive tier math work with shared pools?

### Analysis

**Single FoundUp Model** (initial, WRONG):
- One FoundUp → ~1x ROI (not compelling)
- 012 caught this: "Are you just thinking of One F_i?"

**Ecosystem-Scale Model** (corrected):
Genesis stakers earn from ALL FoundUps, not just one.

```python
# OpenClaw-style S-curve adoption (researched)
# 100k+ installs in 3 months = explosive growth
foundups_by_year = {
    1: 105_000,   # OpenClaw-style explosive launch
    2: 350_000,   # Network effects
    3: 750_000,   # Mass adoption
    4: 1_200_000, # Maturity
    5: 1_500_000  # Saturation
}

# 10 stakers sharing ecosystem Du pool
# Year 1 alone: 18.9x ROI ✓
```

**Degressive Tier Clarification** (012-confirmed):
The three tiers (du/dao/un at 80%/16%/4%) exist WITHIN the Du 4% pool only.

```python
# SHARED pool math (corrected)
individual_share = (du_pool × tier_percentage) / count_at_tier

# As stakers earn >10x → shift to dao tier
# As stakers earn >100x → shift to un tier (lifetime floor)
# Remaining stakers at higher tiers get larger shares
```

**UPS = Demurred BTC** (012-confirmed):
- UPS is "BTC expressed in a demurred state"
- Bio-decay forces velocity (use it or lose it)
- Hotel California: BTC flows IN, never OUT
- BTC reserve grows → UPS capacity strengthens

### Results

| Adoption Model | FoundUps Y1 | Year 1 ROI | Year 5 ROI |
|---------------|-------------|------------|------------|
| Conservative | 3,500 | 0.4x | 5.7x |
| Baseline | 20,000 | 2.2x | 25.8x |
| **OpenClaw-Style** | **105,000** | **18.9x** ✓ | **219.5x** |
| Unicorn | 1,300,000 | 230.8x | 2700x+ |

**Threshold Found**: ~18,000-20,000 FoundUps by Year 5 = 10x ROI for 10 stakers.

## 2026-02-14 - Du Pool Dilution Analysis & Staker Separation (WSP 22, WSP 26)

### Problem
012 asked: "Do we have too many in the founding member pool? Is there even a return for participants?"

Analysis revealed **critical dilution bug**: If all subscribers access Du pool, individual returns → 0.00x ROI.

### Analysis
Created `dilution_scenario.py` to model invite-gated adoption (Gmail, Google Wave patterns):
- Gmail Conservative: 10M members → 0.00x ROI
- AI Wave 2025: 13M members → 0.00x ROI
- FoundUps Baseline: 11M members → 0.00x ROI

**Root cause**: Du 4% pool shared by millions → negligible individual share.

### Solution (012-confirmed)
**Separation of concerns**:
- **Members (subscription)** = Build UPs through WORK → Dao/Un pools ONLY (no Du access)
- **BTC Stakers (anonymous)** = Du pool passive income → INVESTOR treatment

Created `staker_viability.py` to model corrected economics:
- 10 stakers ($1k each) → 10x in 10 months ✓
- 25 stakers ($1k each) → 10x in 26 months ✓
- 100 stakers → 10x in 8+ years (needs higher F_i rate)

### Changes
- **dilution_scenario.py**: Invite-gated adoption modeling (Gmail/Wave patterns)
- **staker_viability.py**: Staker ROI projections, optimal pool sizing
- **pool_distribution.py**:
  - Updated docstring to clarify Du = BTC STAKERS ONLY
  - Added `STAKER_CAP_GENESIS = 100` (best returns)
  - Added `STAKER_CAP_EARLY = 500` (good returns)
  - Added `STAKER_MIN_BTC = 0.001` (~$100 at $100k BTC)
  - Added `STAKER_RECOMMENDED_BTC = 0.01` (~$1k at $100k BTC)
- **economics/__init__.py**: Exported new modules and constants

### Key Insights
```
BROKEN MODEL (all members in Du pool):
- Millions of members → 0.00x ROI → nobody wins

CORRECTED MODEL (stakers-only Du pool):
- 10 stakers ($1k each) → 10x in 10 months ✓
- 25 stakers ($1k each) → 10x in 26 months ✓
- 100+ stakers → requires higher F_i minting rate

BTC stakers ARE investors:
- Capped pool (100-500 stakers max)
- Real capital at risk
- Degressive tiers reward early stakers
- Lifetime floor after 100x (0.16%)
```

## 2026-02-14 - Pool Distribution Refinements (WSP 22, WSP 26)

### Problem
Pool distribution model needed refinement based on 012 session:
- Du pool terminology: "Founders" → "Founding Members + Anonymous Stakers"
- Activity tier shares not divided by count at tier (incorrect math)
- No compute weight for agent payouts
- No degressive staker tier model
- No epoch timing constants

### Solution
Implemented Layer 1 pool model refinements in `economics/pool_distribution.py`:

### Changes
- **pool_distribution.py**:
  - Renamed Du pool terminology to "Founding Members + Anonymous Stakers"
  - Added `ComputeMetrics` dataclass with `compute_weight()` method
  - Added `StakerPosition` dataclass with degressive tier calculation
  - Added `has_active_membership` and `is_genesis_member` flags to `Participant`
  - Fixed `_distribute_stakeholder_pools()` to divide by count at tier
  - Updated `mint_for_work()` to use v3_score × compute_weight
  - Added `COMPUTE_TIER_WEIGHTS` (opus=10, sonnet=3, haiku=1, gemma/qwen=0.5)
  - Added `STAKER_TIER_THRESHOLDS` (du:<10x, dao:10-100x, un:>100x)

- **config.py**: Added epoch timing constants
  - `mini_epoch_ticks: 10` (demurrage cycle)
  - `epoch_ticks: 100` (Du pool distribution - passive)
  - `macro_epoch_ticks: 900` (BTC-F_i ratio snapshot)

- **economics/__init__.py**: Exported new classes and constants

### Key Insights (012-confirmed)
```
Passive vs Active Earning:
- Du (4%): PASSIVE - Founding members/stakers earn every epoch
- Dao (16%): ACTIVE - 0102 agents earn per 3V task
- Un (60%): ACTIVE - 012 stakeholders earn per engagement

Degressive Staker Tiers (within Du 4% pool):
- <10x earned → du tier (80% of pool)
- 10x-100x earned → dao tier (16% of pool)
- >100x earned → un tier (4% of pool = 0.16% total) — lifetime floor

Genesis Member Special Class:
- Earns on ALL FoundUps (ecosystem-wide)
- Class closes at launch (creates FOMO)
```

## 2026-02-13 - Background Simulator SSE Integration (WSP 22)

### Problem
Simulator (Mesa model) and web animation (foundup-cube.js) ran in separate processes. FAMDaemon singleton is process-scoped, so events never reached the SSE server feeding the animation.

### Solution
Added `BackgroundSimulator` class to `sse_server.py` that runs the Mesa model in a background thread within the SSE server process. Shared FAMDaemon singleton enables event flow: Mesa → FAMDaemon → SSE → Web Animation.

### Changes
- **sse_server.py**: Added `BackgroundSimulator` class (daemon thread, configurable founders/users/speed)
- **sse_server.py**: Added CLI flags: `--run-simulator`, `--founders`, `--users`, `--speed`
- **sse_server.py**: New mode `live+simulator` in health endpoint
- **INTERFACE.md**: Documented BackgroundSimulator contract, deployment modes, web animation integration

### Architecture
```
Single Process: sse_server.py --run-simulator
                ├── Mesa Model (background thread)
                ├── FAMDaemon (SHARED singleton)
                └── SSE Server → Web Animation (foundup-cube.js?sim=1)
```

### Usage
```bash
python -m modules.foundups.simulator.sse_server --run-simulator -v
# Browser: http://localhost:5000?sim=1
```

### WSP References
- WSP 22: ModLog documentation
- WSP 50: Pre-action verification (event dedup preserved)
- WSP 72: Module independence (animation untouched, SSE is opt-in)

### Future: FPS (FoundUp Performance Score)
Vision for per-FoundUp simulation vs actual comparison:
- Each FoundUp gets simulation baseline (projected timeline)
- Real FAMDaemon events provide actuals
- Delta scoring: COLD → WARM → HOT → RED HOT CHILLY PEPPER (unicorn)
- Animation reflects FPS via cube color/speed heat map

## 2026-02-12 - Builder Terminology + FAM Module Simulation (WSP 22)

### Terminology Changes (Worker → Builder):
- **event_bus.py**: Added agent lifecycle events (agent_joins, agent_idle, orch_handoff)
- **event_bus.py**: Added FAM module build events (build_registry, build_task_pipeline, etc.)
- **fam_bridge.py**: New emit methods for lifecycle events
  - `emit_agent_joins()`, `emit_agent_idle()`, `emit_orch_handoff()`, `emit_module_build()`

### Agent Lifecycle:
1. JOIN: `01(02) Agent joins F₁`
2. IDLE: Awaiting ORCH handoff (pulsing state)
3. BUILD: `0102 builds MODULE`
4. EARN: `Agent EARNs F₁`

### FAM Module Sequence:
```
REGISTRY → TASK_PIPELINE → PERSISTENCE → EVENTS → TOKEN_ECON → GOVERNANCE → API
```

### WSP References:
- WSP 54: Agent roles and duties
- WSP 77: Agent coordination
- WSP 80: DAE architecture

## 2026-02-18 - SmartDAO Runtime Wiring + Contract Matrix Guardrails (WSP 22, WSP 100)

### Why
- `smartdao_emergence`, `tier_escalation`, `treasury_autonomy`, `cross_dao_funding`, and `phase_command` existed in stream contracts but had no simulator runtime emitters.
- Architecture/doc drift risk remained between simulator contracts, tokenization docs, and skill guidance.

### Changes
- **Runtime SmartDAO wiring**
  - `mesa_model.py`:
    - added deterministic `_process_smartdao_epoch()` with measurable first-principles inputs:
      - adoption ratio from customer penetration (`customer_count / num_user_agents`)
      - treasury estimate from fee treasury + MVP injection + FoundUp UPS treasury
      - active-agent estimate from customer/task throughput
      - explicit treasury-threshold compression factor for finite-horizon simulation runs (preserves tier ordering while making transitions observable)
    - emits:
      - `tier_escalation`
      - `smartdao_emergence` (F0->F1)
      - `treasury_autonomy` (first F2+ transition per FoundUp)
      - `cross_dao_funding` (spawning-fund transfer to lower-tier FoundUps)
      - `phase_command` (`CELEBRATE` on emergence)
    - added SmartDAO metrics to `get_stats()` for observability.
  - `step_pipeline.py`:
    - added SmartDAO epoch cadence hook (`_smartdao_epoch_interval`).
- **Engine safety**
  - `economics/smartdao_spawning.py`:
    - fixed `process_epoch()` dictionary-mutation risk by iterating over key snapshot.
- **Contract clarity**
  - `INTERFACE.md`:
    - replaced SmartDAO payload “extensible object” note with explicit payload schemas.
- **Source-of-truth matrix**
  - added `contracts/source_of_truth_matrix.json`:
    - economic invariants (UPS/sat unit, CABR flow semantics),
    - event-contract emitter ownership,
    - doc/skill alignment references.
- **CI guardrails**
  - expanded `tests/test_docs_contract_alignment.py`:
    - matrix reference paths must exist,
    - matrix-declared events must have explicit emit sites,
    - skill/tokenomics CABR + `total_ups_circulating` semantics must align.
- **New runtime tests**
  - added `tests/test_smartdao_runtime_events.py`:
    - validates emergence + phase command emission,
    - validates F2 autonomy and cross-DAO funding emission.

## 2026-02-21 - Settlement Boundary + Satellite Store Documentation (WSP 78)

### Why
External audit confirmed architecture is mostly aligned but two items were still implicit:
- simulator satellite stores needed explicit retention/ownership policy,
- epoch ledger needed a formal pre-settlement commitment payload to mark Layer D as pending external anchoring.

### Changes
- Added `docs/SATELLITE_STORES.md` with owner/scope/retention/migration decision.
- Extended `economics/epoch_ledger.py` with `prepare_settlement_commitment(epoch)`.
  - Returns explicit `pre_settlement` payload with anchor/merkle/entry summary.
  - Marks `wsp_78_layer=D_pending` and `requires=external_btc_anchor_connector`.
- Added `tests/test_epoch_ledger_settlement_commitment.py`.
- Updated WSP 78 checklist status in framework + knowledge mirrors.

## 2026-02-22 - Layer-D Runtime Wiring (Epoch -> Commitment -> Anchor)

### Why
- Settlement preparation existed (`prepare_settlement_commitment`) but was not invoked by runtime.
- Simulator needed explicit config knobs for safe Layer-D rollout without changing default behavior.

### Changes
- Added Layer-D config knobs in `config.py`:
  - `layer_d_anchor_enabled`
  - `layer_d_anchor_every_n_epochs`
  - `layer_d_anchor_force_republish`
  - `layer_d_anchor_mode`
  - `layer_d_anchor_db_path`
- Added parameter wiring:
  - `params/defaults.json`
  - `params/parameters.schema.json`
  - `parameter_registry.py`
- Wired runtime in `mesa_model.py`:
  - model now creates `EpochLedger` for `F_0` and optional `BTCAnchorConnector` from config.
  - epoch distribution path records ledger entries via `_record_epoch_distribution(...)`.
  - optional anchor publishing emits `settlement_anchor_published` telemetry.
  - `get_stats()` now exposes Layer-D anchor counters and mode.

### Behavior
- Default remains unchanged (`layer_d_anchor_enabled=False`).
- When enabled, anchoring cadence is deterministic by epoch modulo.

## 2026-02-22 - pAVS Submission Checklist Closure

### Why
- Final submission docs had one stale checklist blocker entry even though manuscript base hash already matched repository HEAD.
- Submission bundle manifest needed refresh after checklist edits.

### Changes
- Updated `docs/FOUNDUPS_PAVS_SUBMISSION_CHECKLIST.md`:
  - marked base commit hash item complete.
  - added explicit hash verification evidence (`git rev-parse HEAD`).
  - cleared stale hostile-referee minor findings and remaining blocker.
- Regenerated `docs/FOUNDUPS_PAVS_SUBMISSION_PACKAGE_2026-02-22.zip`.
- Updated `docs/FOUNDUPS_PAVS_SUBMISSION_PACKAGE.md` with refreshed ZIP and checklist hashes.

### Validation
- Manifest ZIP hash verified against actual artifact:
  - `b3f26924fbd36abc1f6bafde59e63eaea1e9cd86cf0db0168c57c502971cbbbf`
