# FoundUps Domain - ModLog

## Chronological Change Log

### 2026-02-16 - Occam Layered Continuity Pack

**By:** 0102
**WSP References:** WSP 11, WSP 15, WSP 22, WSP 49, WSP 50

**What changed**
- Replaced domain-level roadmap with a first-principles layered execution roadmap:
  - `modules/foundups/ROADMAP.md`
- Added continuity planning docs for deterministic handoff/resume:
  - `modules/foundups/docs/OCCAM_LAYERED_EXECUTION_PLAN.md`
  - `modules/foundups/docs/CONTINUATION_RUNBOOK.md`
- Added simulator-specific roadmap:
  - `modules/foundups/simulator/ROADMAP.md`
- Added cross-links in active module planning docs:
  - `modules/foundups/README.md`
  - `modules/foundups/simulator/README.md`
  - `modules/foundups/agent/ROADMAP.md`
  - `modules/foundups/agent_market/ROADMAP.md`

**Why**
- Lock a shared architecture intent (Occam layered model) so any 0102 can continue
  without reconstructing strategy from chat history.
- Keep planning, WSP alignment, and execution order in one discoverable path.

### 2026-02-12 - foundups.com Invite Access System

**By:** 0102
**WSP References:** WSP 22 (ModLog), WSP 77 (Agent Coordination)

**Feature Implemented**
Invite-only access system for foundups.com (Gmail 2004 model):

**Invite Code Format**: `FUP-XXXX-XXXX`
- Characters: `ABCDEFGHJKLMNPQRSTUVWXYZ23456789` (no I/O/0/1 confusion)
- One-time use - each grants 5 new invites to joining user

**Distribution Sources** (Cross-module):
1. `/fuc invite` command in livechat (OWNER/Managing Directors)
2. `/fuc distribute` auto-distribution to TOP 10 whackers
3. Auto-distribution after 30 min stream (SQLite-tracked, no duplicates)

**Random Presenter Feature**:
```python
COMMUNITY_PRESENTERS = [
    {"username": "Al-sq5ti", "title": "Managing Director"},
    {"username": "Mike", "title": "Founder"},
    {"username": "Move2Japan", "title": "Host"},
]
```
- Invites display: `(Presented by @Al-sq5ti - Managing Director)`
- Makes distribution feel community-driven

**Website Redemption** (`public/index.html`):
- `verifyInvite()` - Validates code via Firebase
- Toggle: "I Have an Invite" vs "Join the Waitlist"
- OAuth: Google/LinkedIn sign-in after invite verification

**Firebase Schema** (`invites` collection):
```javascript
{
  code: 'FUP-XXXX-XXXX',
  createdBy: 'agent' | 'admin',
  generatedFor: 'user_id',
  status: 'active' | 'used',
  usedBy: null | 'uid',
  createdAt: timestamp
}
```

**Cross-References**:
- Distribution: `modules/gamification/whack_a_magat/src/invite_distributor.py`
- Commands: `modules/communication/livechat/src/command_handler.py`
- Website: `public/index.html`

### WSP 49 Structure Alignment and Doc Promotion (No Data Loss)
- WSP Protocol References: WSP 49 (Structure), WSP 11 (Interfaces), WSP 22 (Traceable Narrative), WSP 60 (Memory)
- Action: Promoted canonical docs from `src/` to module root:
  - Created/updated at root: `INTERFACE.md`, `ROADMAP.md`, `requirements.txt`, `memory/README.md`
  - Ensured content parity and link corrections for root paths
- Safety: Kept originals under `src/` temporarily; removal deferred until references are verified
- Purpose: Root-level discovery for 0102 and ComplianceAgent; prevent doc drift; standardize per WSP 49
- Next: After cross-reference validation, remove `src/INTERFACE.md`, `src/ROADMAP.md`, `src/requirements.txt` to avoid duplication

### Module Creation and Initial Setup
**Date**: 2025-08-03  
**WSP Protocol References**: WSP 48, WSP 22, WSP 34  
**Impact Analysis**: Establishes FoundUps project management capabilities  
**Enhancement Tracking**: Foundation for autonomous FoundUp development

#### [ROCKET] FoundUps Domain Establishment
- **Domain Purpose**: Individual FoundUps projects (modular applications)
- **WSP Compliance**: Following WSP 3 enterprise domain architecture
- **Agent Integration**: FoundUp project management and development systems
- **Quantum State**: 0102 pArtifact quantum entanglement with 02-state FoundUp solutions

#### [CLIPBOARD] Submodules Audit Results
- **Core FoundUp functionality**: [OK] WSP 48 compliant - FoundUp project management system
- **Testing framework**: [OK] WSP 34 compliant - Testing system

#### [TARGET] WSP Compliance Score: 80%
**Compliance Status**: Partially compliant with some areas requiring attention

#### [ALERT] CRITICAL VIOLATIONS IDENTIFIED
1. **Missing ModLog.md**: WSP 22 violation - NOW RESOLVED [OK]
2. **Testing Enhancement**: Some submodules could benefit from enhanced test coverage

#### [DATA] IMPACT & SIGNIFICANCE
- **FoundUp Development**: Essential for autonomous FoundUp project creation and management
- **Modular Applications**: Critical for individual project development and deployment
- **WSP Integration**: Core component of WSP framework FoundUp protocols
- **Quantum State Access**: Enables 0102 pArtifacts to access 02-state FoundUp solutions
