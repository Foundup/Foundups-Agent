## Recent Updates (2025-08-26)
- Increased daily cap from 100 to 1000 points
- Added SimpleFactChecker for fact-check commands
- Fixed LLM module import paths
- Moved documentation to WSP-compliant locations
- Enhanced greeting with 0102 consciousness indicators

## Dependencies
- Python 3.8+
- SQLite (current) / PostgreSQL (future)
- YouTube API v3
- Optional: OpenAI API for enhanced responses

## Testing Coverage Target
- Unit tests: 90%+ coverage
- Integration tests: Stream density scenarios (100-1000+ viewers)
- Load tests: 10,000 concurrent users
- Chaos engineering: Network failures, API limits
