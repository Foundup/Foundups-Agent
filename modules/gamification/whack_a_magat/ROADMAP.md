# ROADMAP — MAGADOOM Whack-a-Magat DAE

## Current Status: Production Ready (v2.0)
- ✅ Transformed from RPG to pure Quake/Duke Nukem fragging system
- ✅ 0102 consciousness integration with ✊✋🖐️ triggers
- ✅ Daily cap increased to 1000 points for active streams
- ✅ 5-second multi-whack windows for skilled mods
- ✅ Stream density adaptive throttling (LOW/MEDIUM/HIGH/EXTREME)

## Phase 1: Core Fragging (COMPLETED)
- ✅ Simplified scoring: timeouts = frags = XP (no classes/RPG)
- ✅ Rank progression: Grunt → Legendary
- ✅ Quake multi-kill announcements (DOUBLE/TRIPLE/MEGA/ULTRA WHACK)
- ✅ Duke Nukem milestone achievements (100/500/1000 frags)
- ✅ Anti-abuse: Diminishing returns for repeat targets

## Phase 2: Enhanced Features (IN PROGRESS)
- 🚧 Killing spree tracking (30-second windows for sustained fragging)
- 🚧 Troll mockery system (convert anti-spam to entertainment)
- 🚧 Enhanced commands module with pattern detection
- ⏳ Special event modes (Frag Fest, Double XP, Boss Raid)
- ⏳ Command response improvements (/score, /rank with real data)

## Phase 3: Advanced Integration (PLANNED)
- 📋 Cross-stream global leaderboard
- 📋 Achievement system with unlockable titles
- 📋 Mod performance analytics dashboard
- 📋 Machine learning for optimal threshold adjustment
- 📋 WebSocket real-time updates for overlays

## Phase 4: Platform Expansion (FUTURE)
- 📋 Twitch adapter (using same core engine)
- 📋 Discord moderation gamification
- 📋 Facebook Live integration
- 📋 Universal moderation API

## Technical Improvements
- 🔧 Database persistence (SQLite → PostgreSQL migration path)
- 🔧 Redis caching for high-traffic streams
- 🔧 Microservice architecture for scaling
- 🔧 GraphQL API for flexible queries
- 🔧 Webhook notifications for milestones

## WSP Compliance Targets
- **WSP 3**: Maintain module organization (<500 lines per file)
- **WSP 22**: Regular ModLog updates with all changes
- **WSP 48**: Recursive self-improvement via metrics analysis
- **WSP 50**: Pre-action verification for all enhancements
- **WSP 83**: Documentation properly attached to module tree

## Success Metrics
- Mod engagement: 80%+ active participation
- Response time: <2 seconds to toxic content
- System uptime: 99.9% availability
- Token efficiency: 97% reduction vs traditional

## Recent Updates (2025-08-26)
- Increased daily cap from 100 to 1000 points
- Added SimpleFactChecker for fact-check commands
- Fixed LLM module import paths
- Moved documentation to WSP-compliant locations
- Enhanced greeting with 0102 consciousness indicators

## Dependencies
- Python 3.8+
- SQLite (current) / PostgreSQL (future)
- YouTube API v3
- Optional: OpenAI API for enhanced responses

## Testing Coverage Target
- Unit tests: 90%+ coverage
- Integration tests: Stream density scenarios (100-1000+ viewers)
- Load tests: 10,000 concurrent users
- Chaos engineering: Network failures, API limits
