## 🎮 Game Mechanics (Core)

- **Moderators = Players**: Each mod tracked as MAGADOOM player
- **Timeouts = Whacks**: Every timeout/ban = 1 whack + XP points
- **Cumulative Stats**: All whacks and XP persist in database across sessions
- **Real-time Updates**: Stats update immediately when timeouts happen

## 🗑️ Removed Commands (Non-MAGADOOM)

### REDUNDANT:
- ~~`/level`~~ - Info now in `/score`  
- ~~`/stats`~~ - Same as `/score`

## 🎯 MAGADOOM Philosophy

**Pure whacking focus**: Mods time out trolls → Get whacks → Earn XP → Climb ranks → Achieve glory

No educational content, no complex mechanics - just DOOM-style whacking action for YouTube moderation!
