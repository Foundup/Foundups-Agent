## [GAME] Game Mechanics (Core)

- **Moderators = Players**: Each mod tracked as MAGADOOM player
- **Timeouts = Whacks**: Every timeout/ban = 1 whack + XP points
- **Cumulative Stats**: All whacks and XP persist in database across sessions
- **Real-time Updates**: Stats update immediately when timeouts happen

## [U+1F5D1]️ Removed Commands (Non-MAGADOOM)

### REDUNDANT:
- ~~`/level`~~ - Info now in `/score`  
- ~~`/stats`~~ - Same as `/score`

### NON-MAGADOOM THEMED:
- ~~`/quiz`~~ - Educational content  
- ~~`/answer`~~ - Quiz answers
- ~~`/facts`~~ - Historical facts
- ~~`/fscale`~~ - Personality tests
- ~~`/rate`~~ - Rating systems

## [TARGET] MAGADOOM Philosophy

**Pure whacking focus**: Mods time out trolls -> Get whacks -> Earn XP -> Climb ranks -> Achieve glory

No educational content, no complex mechanics - just DOOM-style whacking action for YouTube moderation!
