# Recursive Improvement Module

**Sprint 2 Task 1 (RED CUBE - P0 Critical+)**  
**WSP 48 Level 1 Protocol Implementation**

## Purpose

Implements WSP 48 Recursive Self-Improvement Protocol, enabling the system to automatically learn from errors, extract patterns, and improve itself without manual intervention. This creates an exponential growth curve in system capabilities through recursive enhancement cycles.

## Architecture

### Core Components

1. **Recursive Learning Engine (RLE)**
   - Learns from errors and generates improvements
   - Extracts reusable patterns from exceptions
   - Updates WSP protocols automatically

2. **Error Pattern Extractor**
   - Converts exceptions to patterns
   - Stores in pattern memory
   - Prevents recurrence

3. **Solution Memory Bank**
   - Remembers solutions from 0201 quantum state
   - Pattern-based recall (not computation)
   - Token-efficient retrieval

4. **WSP Protocol Updater**
   - Applies improvements to framework
   - Maintains compliance during updates
   - Tracks improvement effectiveness

## Features

- **Automatic Error Learning**: Every error becomes a learning opportunity
- **Pattern Extraction**: Converts errors to reusable prevention patterns
- **Quantum Remembrance**: Solutions recalled from 0201 state
- **Self-Updating**: WSP protocols evolve automatically
- **Token Efficiency**: 90% reduction through pattern memory
- **Exponential Growth**: Each improvement accelerates future improvements

## Usage

### Python API
```python
from modules.infrastructure.recursive_improvement import RecursiveEngine

# Initialize engine
engine = RecursiveEngine()

# Process an error (automatic learning)
try:
    # Some operation that fails
    risky_operation()
except Exception as e:
    improvement = await engine.process_error(e)
    print(f"Learned: {improvement.pattern}")
    print(f"Prevention: {improvement.solution}")
```

### Automatic Integration
```python
# Install as global error handler
import sys
from modules.infrastructure.recursive_improvement import install_global_handler

install_global_handler()
# Now ALL errors trigger learning automatically
```

### Command Line
```bash
# View learned patterns
python -m modules.infrastructure.recursive_improvement.tools.view_patterns

# Apply pending improvements
python -m modules.infrastructure.recursive_improvement.tools.apply_improvements

# Generate learning report
python -m modules.infrastructure.recursive_improvement.tools.learning_report
```

## Learning Patterns

### Pattern 1: Error ↁESolution ↁEPrevention
```yaml
Trigger: FileNotFoundError
Pattern: Missing file at expected location
Solution: Create file with template
Prevention: Check file exists before access
Learning: Add existence check to all file operations
```

### Pattern 2: WSP Violation ↁEFix ↁEEnhancement
```yaml
Trigger: WSP 49 violation (test in wrong location)
Pattern: Test file not in tests/ directory
Solution: Move to correct location
Prevention: Validate location before creation
Learning: Update all test creation to check location first
```

### Pattern 3: Performance ↁEOptimization ↁEAcceleration
```yaml
Trigger: Token limit exceeded
Pattern: Inefficient operation sequence
Solution: Use pattern memory instead
Prevention: Check pattern memory first
Learning: Always prefer patterns over computation
```

## Metrics

### Learning Velocity
```python
@dataclass
class LearningMetrics:
    errors_encountered: int = 0
    patterns_extracted: int = 0
    solutions_remembered: int = 0
    improvements_applied: int = 0
    recurrence_prevented: int = 0
    tokens_saved: int = 0
    
    @property
    def learning_rate(self) -> float:
        """Patterns learned per error"""
        if self.errors_encountered == 0:
            return 0
        return self.patterns_extracted / self.errors_encountered
    
    @property
    def prevention_rate(self) -> float:
        """Percentage of errors prevented"""
        total = self.errors_encountered + self.recurrence_prevented
        if total == 0:
            return 0
        return self.recurrence_prevented / total
```

## Integration Points

### WSP Framework
- **WSP 48**: Core recursive improvement protocol
- **WSP 64**: Violation prevention integration
- **WSP 60**: Memory architecture compliance
- **WSP 22**: ModLog updates for improvements

### WRE Core
- Integrates with WRE orchestrator
- Shares patterns with all components
- Enables collective intelligence

### DAE Architecture
- Each DAE learns independently
- Cross-DAE pattern sharing (future)
- Collective memory growth

## Success Criteria

### Sprint 2 Targets
- Error prevention rate: > 95%
- Pattern extraction: > 100/day
- Token savings: > 50%
- Learning velocity: Exponential
