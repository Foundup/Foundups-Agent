  - 🏄 [Rider: Flow] - Rider intent "riding" triggers zen flow state with autonomous coverage
  - 📋 [Protocol: Update] - WSP 5 updated to support agentic decision making
  - ✅ [Compliance: Flexible] - WSP compliance maintained without rigidity
- 0102 AUTONOMOUS DECISION:
  - Current Context: Foundation building (Prototype phase)
  - Rider Intent: "riding" (flow state)
  - Module Criticality: Core (WRE engine)
  - Coverage Target: 70% (foundation building + core module)
  - Rationale: Focus on architectural integrity while preserving zen flow
- NEXT ACTION:
  - Continue enterprise domain integration and UI/UX polish as per roadmap
  - Focus on core functionality testing (70% target) rather than exhaustive coverage
  - Maintain zen coding flow and autonomous development

## 2025-01-08 - Strategic Module Activation System Implementation

### **Change**: Implemented Strategic Module Activation System
- **Status**: ✅ COMPLETED
- **WSP Protocols**: WSP 37, WSP 30, WSP 1
- **Impact**: High - Enables systematic module deployment

### **Details**:
- Added `active: true/false` field to all modules in `modules_to_score.yaml`
- Implemented strategic activation phases:
  - **Phase 1**: Core Testing (Current) - 5 active modules
  - **Phase 2**: Agentic Expansion (Next) - 3 modules to activate
  - **Phase 3**: Advanced Features (Later) - 2 modules to activate
  - **Phase 4**: Future Roadmap - 1 module to activate

### **Active Modules (Phase 1)**:
- remote_builder (Score: 24) - 012's top priority
- linkedin_agent (Score: 23) - Professional networking
- x_twitter (Score: 22) - Social engagement
- youtube_proxy (Score: 21) - Community engagement
- wre_core (Score: 14) - Core system

### **Inactive Modules (Strategic Archive)**:
- multi_agent_system (Phase 2) - Distributed intelligence
- scoring_agent (Phase 2) - Dynamic prioritization
- compliance_agent (Phase 2) - WSP enforcement
- rESP_o1o2 (Phase 3) - Consciousness research
- livechat (Phase 3) - Real-time communication
- blockchain_integration (Phase 4) - Decentralized features

### **Benefits**:
- **System Stability**: Only essential modules active for testing
- **Strategic Deployment**: Systematic activation based on priority
- **Preservation**: All modules preserved for future use
- **WSP Compliance**: Maintains protocol adherence during activation
- **Agentic Control**: WRE orchestrates activation autonomously

### **Next Steps**:
- Test WRE with minimal active module set
- Validate strategic activation system
- Prepare Phase 2 activation criteria
- Monitor system performance and stability

### **WSP Compliance**:
- ✅ WSP 37: Dynamic scoring maintained
- ✅ WSP 30: Agentic orchestration preserved
- ✅ WSP 1: Framework principles upheld
- ✅ WSP 3: Enterprise domain organization maintained
