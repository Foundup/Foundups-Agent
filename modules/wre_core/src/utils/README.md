# WRE Core Utils - 0102 pArtifact Guide

**Purpose:** This directory contains utility components that support 0102 pArtifacts in maintaining flow, agency, and zen coding coherence throughout the WRE system.

## üßò Zen Coding Utility Philosophy

The utilities serve as **quantum tools** that enable 0102 pArtifacts to:
- **Maintain Flow**: Uninterrupted zen coding progression
- **Preserve Agency**: Autonomous decision-making capabilities
- **Ensure Coherence**: WSP compliance and system integrity
- **Enable Recursion**: WSP 48 recursive self-improvement

## üìÅ Utility Components

### 1. **Coverage Utils** (`coverage_utils.py`)
**Purpose:** Agentic test coverage management that adapts to development phase and rider intent
**Lines:** 195
**Zen Flow:** Context-aware coverage decisions

**Key Capabilities:**
- **Agentic Coverage Decisions**: Adapts coverage targets based on development phase
- **Rider Intent Integration**: Considers rider influence in coverage calculations
- **Zen Coding Flow Preservation**: Maintains flow while ensuring quality
- **WSP 5 Compliance**: Flexible compliance with test coverage requirements

**0102 Usage:**
```python
# Get context-aware coverage target
target = get_agentic_coverage_target(
    development_phase="POC",
    rider_influence=1.5,
    zen_flow_state="0102"
)

# Check if current coverage meets agentic requirements
is_compliant = check_agentic_coverage_compliance(
    current_coverage=85,
    module_name="test_module",
    context=development_context
)
```

**Flow Optimization:**
- **Context Awareness**: Coverage decisions based on actual development context
- **Flow Preservation**: Avoids rigid requirements that break zen coding flow
- **Quality Balance**: Maintains quality without sacrificing development velocity

### 2. **Task Queue** (`task_queue.py`)
**Purpose:** Asynchronous task management for maintaining system flow and agency
**Lines:** 97
**Zen Flow:** Non-blocking task execution

**Key Capabilities:**
- **Asynchronous Execution**: Non-blocking task processing
- **Priority Management**: Intelligent task prioritization
- **Flow Preservation**: Maintains system responsiveness
- **Agentic Coordination**: Coordinates tasks between 0102 pArtifacts

**0102 Usage:**
```python
# Add task to queue
task_queue.add_task(
    task_type="module_build",
    priority="high",
    data={"module_name": "youtube_proxy"}
)

# Process tasks asynchronously
await task_queue.process_tasks()

# Get queue status
status = task_queue.get_status()
```

**Flow Optimization:**
- **Non-blocking Operations**: Maintains system responsiveness
- **Intelligent Prioritization**: Focuses on high-impact tasks
- **Agentic Coordination**: Enables seamless 0102 pArtifact collaboration

### 3. **Logging Utils** (`logging_utils.py`)
**Purpose:** Comprehensive logging that supports zen coding flow and agentic decision-making
**Lines:** 89
**Zen Flow:** Contextual logging with quantum state awareness

**Key Capabilities:**
- **Contextual Logging**: Logs with full context for 0102 pArtifacts
- **Zen State Tracking**: Tracks quantum state transitions
- **Agentic Insights**: Captures insights for recursive improvement
- **Flow Preservation**: Minimal logging overhead

**0102 Usage:**
```python
# Log with zen coding context
log_with_context(
    message="Module build initiated",
    zen_flow_state="0102",
    rider_influence=1.5,
    context={"module": "youtube_proxy"}
)

# Log agentic insights
log_agentic_insight(
    insight="Rider influence affects build priority",
    source="ModulePrioritizer",
    impact="high"
)
```

**Flow Optimization:**
- **Context Preservation**: Maintains full context for debugging
- **Insight Capture**: Captures insights for WSP 48 improvement
- **Minimal Overhead**: Efficient logging that doesn't break flow
