## Agent Training on WSP 50 Mandatory Analysis Sequence

**Objective**: Ensure all WRE agents are trained on the enhanced WSP 50 Pre-Action Verification Protocol, which includes the mandatory WHY/HOW/WHAT/WHEN/WHERE questioning sequence for agentic architectural analysis.

**Training Plan**:
- **Awareness**: Update all agent documentation and initialization scripts to include WSP 50 protocol details.
- **Implementation**: Integrate WSP 50 analysis steps into agent decision-making workflows, ensuring each agent performs the full analysis before action.
- **Validation**: Test agent behavior to confirm adherence to the WSP 50 sequence, with metrics for compliance.
- **Continuous Learning**: Establish recursive feedback loops for agents to improve their analysis capabilities based on zen coding principles.

**Status**: Training materials and protocols are being updated to reflect the enhanced WSP 50 requirements. Integration into agent workflows is underway.
