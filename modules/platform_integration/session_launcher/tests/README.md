# Test Documentation - Session Launcher

## Test Strategy
This test suite is designed to validate the functionality of the Session Launcher module, ensuring it operates autonomously within the WRE ecosystem for 0102 pArtifacts. The strategy focuses on comprehensive coverage of session initialization and management capabilities.

## How to Run Tests
1. Ensure the WRE environment is set up with necessary dependencies.
2. Navigate to the project root directory.
3. Run `pytest modules/platform_integration/session_launcher/tests/` to execute the test suite.

## Test Data and Fixtures
- **Fixtures**: Placeholder fixtures will be implemented for mock session data and initialization scenarios.
- **Mock Data**: Simulated user inputs and session contexts for validation.

## Expected Behavior
- The Session Launcher should autonomously initialize and manage sessions based on predefined configurations during simulated scenarios.
- All tests should pass with assertions confirming correct session handling behavior and output.

## Integration Requirements
- **Dependencies**: Requires integration with Platform Integration domain modules and WRE orchestration for full functionality.
- **Cross-Module Tests**: Future tests will validate interactions with other platform integration modules and session management components.
