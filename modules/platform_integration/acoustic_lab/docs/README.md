## WSP Compliance

This documentation follows WSP 83 (Documentation Tree Attachment) protocol, ensuring all documentation is properly attached to the system tree and maintained with code changes.

## Documentation References

This comprehensive documentation suite is properly referenced throughout the Acoustic Lab module:

- **[README.md](../README.md)** - Module overview with documentation links
- **[ROADMAP.md](../ROADMAP.md)** - Development planning with technical references
- **[ModLog.md](../ModLog.md)** - Change tracking with documentation updates
- **[INTERFACE.md](../INTERFACE.md)** - API specification with implementation details

All module files now include proper cross-references to this documentation tree, ensuring WSP 83 compliance and maintainability.

## Maintenance
