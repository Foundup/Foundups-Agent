## Core Components

### Audio Processing Engine
- **MFCC Fingerprinting**: Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients for audio signature matching
- **Peak Detection**: Identifies sharp sound events (>1kHz frequency content)
- **Window Extraction**: Captures 0.2-second analysis windows around detected peaks

### Triangulation Engine
- **Time-of-Arrival Analysis**: Calculates sound source location from GPS + time delays
- **Speed of Sound**: Uses 1100 ft/s (air at room temperature)
- **Coordinate Calculation**: Determines latitude/longitude from multiple sensor positions

### Input Processing
- **File Upload**: Direct WAV file upload with drag-and-drop interface
- **X Video Integration**: URL-based processing of X (Twitter) videos with audio extraction
- **Memory Processing**: All operations performed in RAM with no disk storage

### Synthetic Audio Library
- **Tone A, B, C**: Three distinct synthetic audio signatures
- **Fingerprint Database**: Pre-computed MFCC features for matching
- **Confidence Thresholding**: 80% minimum match confidence

## Educational Focus

This tool teaches fundamental acoustic principles:
- **Mathematics of Triangulation**: Geometric calculations for source localization
- **Audio Signal Processing**: MFCC analysis and fingerprinting techniques
- **Sensor Network Concepts**: Distributed data collection and processing

## Usage

### Web Interface
```bash
# Start the educational web application
python -m modules.platform_integration.acoustic_lab.src.web_app
```

### API Endpoint
```python
# Upload synthetic audio file for analysis
POST /upload
Content-Type: multipart/form-data

# Returns JSON analysis results
{
  "location": [latitude, longitude],
  "sound_type": "Tone A",
  "confidence": 0.84,
  "triangulation_data": {...}
}
```

## Security & Privacy

- **No Data Persistence**: All processing in memory, auto-deletion after response
- **IP Geofencing**: Restricted to educational/demo access (Utah state only)
- **Synthetic Data Only**: Uses generated audio, no real-world recordings
- **Ethereum Proof-of-Existence**: SHA-256 hashes logged to testnet for educational verification

## Integration Points

- **Standalone Educational Tool**: Complete web application for acoustic learning
- **Research Platform**: Foundation for acoustic signal processing studies
- **Demonstration System**: Shows practical applications of audio analysis algorithms
