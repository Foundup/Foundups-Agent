# Test Documentation - Consent Engine

## Test Strategy
This test suite is designed to validate the functionality of the Consent Engine module, ensuring it operates autonomously within the WRE ecosystem for 0102 pArtifacts. The strategy focuses on comprehensive coverage of consent management and user permission handling capabilities.

## How to Run Tests
1. Ensure the WRE environment is set up with necessary dependencies.
2. Navigate to the project root directory.
3. Run `pytest modules/infrastructure/consent_engine/tests/` to execute the test suite.

## Test Data and Fixtures
- **Fixtures**: Placeholder fixtures will be implemented for mock consent data and permission scenarios.
- **Mock Data**: Simulated user inputs and consent contexts for validation.

## Expected Behavior
- The Consent Engine should autonomously manage and validate user consents based on predefined policies during simulated scenarios.
- All tests should pass with assertions confirming correct consent handling behavior and output.

## Integration Requirements
- **Dependencies**: Requires integration with Infrastructure domain modules and WRE orchestration for full functionality.
- **Cross-Module Tests**: Future tests will validate interactions with other infrastructure modules and user management components.
