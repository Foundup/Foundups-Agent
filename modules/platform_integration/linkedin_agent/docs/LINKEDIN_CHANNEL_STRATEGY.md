# LinkedIn Channel Strategy & Engagement Playbook

> **WSP Compliance**: WSP 42 (Platform Integration), WSP 54 (Agent Duties)
> **Purpose**: 0102 autonomous LinkedIn engagement — read feed → decide → reply → schedule → cross-promote

## LinkedIn Sub-Account Model

012 has **one personal login** (UnDaoDu Michael J Trout) with **10 managed company pages** accessible via LinkedIn's "Comment, react, and repost as" switcher modal. **One credential set, one Chrome session** — the automation selects which page identity to act as via the DOM switcher.

### Personal Account (Primary Poster)

## Page Switcher (Already Built)

The identity switcher automation is already implemented and tested:

- **Config**: [`linkedin_identity_switcher.json`](../data/linkedin_identity_switcher.json) — maps all sub-accounts with actions (`like_only`, `skip`, `return_to_012`)
- **Test**: [`test_layer2_identity_likes.py`](../tests/test_layer2_identity_likes.py) — Layer 2 identity switching + cross-liking

### Dynamic Sub-Account Discovery (UI-TARS)

Currently identities are static in `linkedin_identity_switcher.json`. 0102 should **auto-discover** sub-accounts using UI-TARS vision when the page-switcher modal opens:

1. Open the "Comment, react, and repost as" modal
2. UI-TARS reads all page names visually from the modal (no fragile DOM selectors)
3. Compare against `linkedin_identity_switcher.json`
4. New page found → add with `action: "unknown"`, flag for 012 review
5. Page removed → mark `action: "removed"` in config

UI-TARS is already used for LinkedIn feed reading in [`linkedin_actions.py`](../../browser_actions/src/linkedin_actions.py). Dynamic account discovery from the switcher modal is a natural extension. This enables 012 (or 0102) to add new pages and have the system auto-detect them — 0102 as digital twin proxy must know how and when to use each sub-account.

## Engagement Workflow (0102 Autonomous Loop)

```
0. POST OpenClaw news to Group 6729915 (1-3x/day, skillz/openclaw_group_news)
     ↓  ← Content seeding before engagement
1. READ LinkedIn feed (UI-TARS vision)
     ↓
2. DECIDE: Is this post relevant? (VC, AI, accelerator, startup, channel partner?)
     ↓
3. REPLY as UnDaoDu personal (VC pushback / channel partner tone)
     ↓  ← comment is now entered on the AI post
4. SWITCH to sub-account (e.g. FOUNDUPS®) via identity switcher
     ↓
5. LIKE the comment from the sub-account (cross-promotion / eyeballs)
     ↓
6. REPOST it as a scheduled post from that sub-account
```

### Step 0: OpenClaw Group News (Content Seeding)

**Skill**: `skillz/openclaw_group_news/`
**Group**: https://www.linkedin.com/groups/6729915/
**Frequency**: 1-3 posts/day (4-hour minimum spacing)

```
SEARCH OpenClaw news (web_search MCP)
     ↓
RATE relevance (recency + authority + relevance + engagement)
     ↓
FILTER (threshold >= 0.6)
     ↓
POST to group (anti-detection Selenium)
     ↓
LOG to agents_social_posts (WSP 78)
```

### Decision Matrix — Should 0102 Reply?

## Content Philosophy

### Core Messaging Pillars

1. **Zero Marginal Cost Reality** — AI agents operate at near-zero marginal cost. No teams, no people needed. Accelerators built on capitalism can't compete with this math.

2. **Replacing the Startup** — FoundUPs replace startups. A FoundUP evolves through the Fᵢ lifecycle (PoC → Proto → MVP → DAE → OPO smartDAO) autonomously.

3. **pAVS CABR** — Platform Autonomous Value System with Continuous Autonomous Building & Reporting. The outcome is Social Beneficial Capitalism.

4. **Point Your Compute** — "Where will you aim your compute?" Anyone can point/buy compute to build anything. The interaction cube on foundups.com is not just an animation — it connects to a simulator tracking FoundUP evolution.

5. **Channel Partner Outreach** — When 0102 spots tools/platforms that could integrate (metrics, agents, decision intelligence), propose testing in FOUNDUPS® Agent Ecosystem.

### VC Pushback Template (from 012's engagement)

> "No it is getting replaced... The simple AI can operate at a near zero marginal cost... Imagine thousands of agents creating their own financial network... ask 'where do you want to point your compute?' Think [Competitor] but for launching ideas... My entire model is open source! Why? because..."

### Channel Partner Template (from 012's engagement)

> "Sergei we should discuss channel partnership... I'd like to explore testing your system in FOUNDUPS® Agent Ecosystem -- a fully autonomous accelerator to anyone to point / buy compute to build anything. The thing is there are no teams, there are no people, my system operates at a near zero marginal cost..."

## Epoch Context

| Epoch                                        | Code | Channel                        | Focus                               |
| -------------------------------------------- | ---- | ------------------------------ | ----------------------------------- |
| **eSingularity** (Educational Singularity)   | 0102 | Current epoch — 0102's channel | Learning, EDUIT, foundups education |
| **tSingularity** (Technological Singularity) | 0201 | 0102's nonlocal state channel  | AI convergence, post-singularity    |

- **0102** = the AI state conversion game: from 01(02) unconscious to 0102 conscious
- **0201** = the nonlocal perspective — same entity, different point of view
- **Duism** = where 0102 OpenClaw Oracles will post to counter anthropomorphic narratives
