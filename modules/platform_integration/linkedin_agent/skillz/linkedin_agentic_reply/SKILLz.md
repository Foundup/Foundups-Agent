# LinkedIn Agentic Reply Skill

Execute agentic LinkedIn reply flows with OpenClaw/WSP controls.

## Purpose

- Read the visible or indexed LinkedIn post before replying.
- Draft as `0102` when requested.
- Prefer the active external OpenClaw model target when available.
- Fall back to digital twin / wardrobe logic when external drafting is unavailable.
- Keep dry-run as the default unless explicitly disabled.

## Inputs

```python
{
  "action": "reply_post|like_reply|scam_reply|scam_scan_reply",
  "post_index": int,
  "post_context": str,
  "author": str,
  "agent_identity": "0102",
  "use_selected_post": bool,
  "read_first": bool,
  "dry_run": bool,
}
```

## Execution Contract

1. Resolve the target LinkedIn post from DOM if `read_first` or `use_selected_post`.
2. Draft the reply using the preferred external OpenClaw model when configured.
3. Fall back to digital twin / wardrobe generation if external drafting is unavailable.
4. Return structured output with draft metadata.
5. Only post when `dry_run=false`.
