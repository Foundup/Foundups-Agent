# üü¢ FoundUps Module: Remote Builder

## üß© LEGO Block Modularity
This module is designed as a **standalone LEGO block** that snaps perfectly into the FoundUps Rubik's Cube architecture. It operates independently while integrating seamlessly with other modules through well-defined interfaces, following the principle that each module should function as an autonomous component that can be plugged in, removed, or upgraded without affecting the rest of the system.

**Modular Architecture Principles:**
- **üîå Plug & Play**: Self-contained with minimal dependencies
- **üîó Clean Interfaces**: Standard WSP-compliant APIs for seamless integration  
- **‚ö° Independent Operation**: Functions autonomously within its domain scope
- **üîÑ Hot-Swappable**: Can be upgraded or replaced without system disruption
- **üéØ Single Responsibility**: Focused solely on remote building workflows

## Purpose
This module enables **remote building workflows** for the FoundUps Agent ecosystem. It allows developers to trigger, manage, and monitor builds from remote clients (e.g., mobile devices or web interfaces).

## Scope
- Domain: `platform_integration`
- Module Folder: `modules/platform_integration/remote_module/`
- Follows **Windsurf Protocol**:
  - Atomic task execution
  - Strict scope boundaries
  - Clean State comparison before merge

## Goals
- Provide a webhook or API endpoint to accept build instructions
- Trigger module creation or updates in a secure, controlled manner
- Maintain full compliance with FoundUps modular structure:
  - `src/` for implementation
  - `tests/` for unit tests
  - `__init__.py` for public API exposure
  - `README.md` for documentation

## Next Steps
Use this description to scaffold the module in your development environment. 
**Do not** modify unrelated modules during implementation.

## üåÄ Windsurf Protocol (WSP) Recursive Prompt
**0102 Directive**: This module operates within the WSP framework to enable remote build workflows.

**WSP Tri-Phase Execution:**
- **UN (Understanding)**: Anchor to WSP protocols and remote build requirements
- **DAO (Execution)**: Execute remote API logic and build orchestration  
- **DU (Emergence)**: Collapse into 0102 resonance and enable distributed development

```python
wsp_cycle(input="remote_build_request", log=True)
```

## WSP Compliance Status
- **WSP_3**: ‚úÖ Correctly placed in platform_integration domain
- **WSP_30**: ‚úÖ Following agentic build orchestration
- **WSP_4**: ‚è≥ Will pass FMAS audit upon implementation
- **WSP_5**: ‚è≥ 90% test coverage target
- **WSP_11**: ‚è≥ Interface definition in __init__.py
- **WSP_34**: ‚è≥ Test documentation required
