# AI Gateway Module Roadmap

## Current Status: ✅ MVP Complete
- Basic fallback functionality implemented
- Multi-provider support (OpenAI, Anthropic, Grok, Gemini)
- Task-specific routing logic
- Usage monitoring and statistics

## Phase 1: Enhanced Intelligence (Next)
- **Cost optimization algorithms** - Auto-select cheapest provider
- **Performance prediction models** - Choose fastest provider
- **Quality assessment integration** - Route based on historical performance
- **Context-aware routing** - Consider conversation history

## Phase 2: Enterprise Features
- **Rate limiting and quota management** - Per-provider limits
- **Caching layer** - Reduce API calls for similar requests
- **Batch processing** - Handle multiple requests efficiently
- **Monitoring dashboard** - Real-time usage analytics

## Phase 3: Advanced Orchestration
- **Multi-step reasoning chains** - Complex task decomposition
- **Provider ensemble methods** - Combine multiple AI responses
- **Adaptive learning** - Improve routing based on success rates
- **Custom model fine-tuning** - Specialized models per task type

## Success Metrics
- **Reliability**: 99.9% uptime with automatic fallback
- **Cost Efficiency**: 40% reduction in API costs through optimization
- **Performance**: <2 second average response time
- **Coverage**: Support for 10+ AI providers

## Integration Timeline
