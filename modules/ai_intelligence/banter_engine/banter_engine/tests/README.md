# Banter Engine Module Test Suite

This directory contains tests for the Banter Engine module, which handles emoji-tone mapping, responses, and interaction patterns.

## Test Files

| Test File | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| test_banter.py | Basic tests for banter functionality and responses |
| test_banter_engine.py | Comprehensive tests for the core banter engine logic |
| test_banter_trigger.py | Tests for trigger detection and response mechanisms |
| test_emoji_sequence_map.py | Tests for the emoji sequence mapping and interpretation |

## Test Coverage

The test suite aims to maintain high coverage of the Banter Engine module in compliance with WSP 5 requirements.

## Running Tests

To run all tests for the Banter Engine module:

```bash
python -m pytest modules/banter_engine/tests/
```

To run with coverage reporting:

```bash
python -m pytest modules/banter_engine/tests/ --cov=modules.banter_engine.src --cov-report term-missing
```

## Module Test Design

The Banter Engine tests focus on:

1. **Response Generation**: Verifying that appropriate responses are generated for different inputs
2. **Trigger Detection**: Ensuring that triggers are properly detected in various message formats
3. **Emoji Handling**: Testing the mapping between emoji patterns and tone/response types
4. **Edge Cases**: Validating behavior with unusual or boundary input conditions

These tests ensure that the Banter Engine correctly interprets user messages and generates appropriate responses based on the defined rules and patterns.
