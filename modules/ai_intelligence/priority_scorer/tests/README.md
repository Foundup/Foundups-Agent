# Test Documentation - Priority Scorer

## Test Strategy
This test suite is designed to validate the functionality of the Priority Scorer module, ensuring it operates autonomously within the WRE ecosystem for 0102 pArtifacts. The strategy focuses on comprehensive coverage of priority scoring algorithms and decision-making processes.

## How to Run Tests
1. Ensure the WRE environment is set up with necessary dependencies.
2. Navigate to the project root directory.
3. Run `pytest modules/ai_intelligence/priority_scorer/tests/` to execute the test suite.

## Test Data and Fixtures
- **Fixtures**: Placeholder fixtures will be implemented for mock data and scoring scenarios.
- **Mock Data**: Simulated inputs and priority contexts for algorithm validation.

## Expected Behavior
- The Priority Scorer should autonomously evaluate and assign priorities based on predefined criteria during simulated scenarios.
- All tests should pass with assertions confirming correct scoring behavior and output.

## Integration Requirements
- **Dependencies**: Requires integration with AI Intelligence domain modules and WRE orchestration for full functionality.
- **Cross-Module Tests**: Future tests will validate interactions with other AI modules and decision-making components.
