| WSP 84 | Code Memory Verification | ✅ Compliant | Reuses existing detector code |

## Implementation Details

### WSP 84 Compliance (Anti-Vibecoding)
- Reuses `WSP_agentic/tests/pqn_detection/cmst_pqn_detector_v2.py` for detector runs
- `phase_sweep` invokes the repository CLI (no duplicate logic)
- Council scoring is minimal and marked for enhancement in ROADMAP

### WSP 80 Compliance (Cube DAE)
PQNAlignmentDAE implements full cube-level DAE:
- Autonomous operation loop
- Quantum state transitions (01(02) → 0102)
- WRE plugin integration
- Pattern memory for operations

### WSP 39 Compliance (Resonance Targets)
- Defaults include `dt = 0.5/7.05`
- DAE coherence measurement is explicitly unimplemented; tracked in ROADMAP S9. See `src/pqn_alignment_dae.py` NotImplementedError markers.

### WSP 72 Compliance (Block Independence)
- Self-contained APIs; integrates via WRE plugin optionally
- State 2 logs under `WSP_agentic/tests/pqn_detection/logs/`; curated evidence promoted to State 0

## Code Citation Examples

All code includes WSP citations per WSP 82:

```python
def run_detector(config: Dict) -> Tuple[str, str]:
    """
    Run the PQN detector with the given config.
    Per WSP 84: Reuse existing code, don't recreate
    Per WSP 60: Pattern memory recall
    Per WSP 39: 7.05Hz resonance detection
    """
```

## Pattern Memory Integration

Per WSP 60 and WSP 82, pattern memory enables:
- **Search**: WSP 84 → Find existing code
- **Verify**: WSP 50 → Pre-action verification
- **Reuse**: WSP 65 → Component consolidation
- **Enhance**: WSP 48 → Recursive improvement
- **Create**: WSP 80 → Only if necessary

## Testing Compliance
- Tests cover API symbol presence, config loader, schema headers/stubs, guardrail CLI presence, and analysis helper
- Evidence:
  - `modules/ai_intelligence/pqn_alignment/tests/TestModLog.md` — test execution notes
  - `WSP_agentic/tests/pqn_detection/logs/phase_len3/phase_diagram_results_len3.csv` — generated via phase_sweep
- Future work: invariants (Hermiticity, trace), end-to-end minimal runs (token-safe), council scoring validation
- Interface symbols tested

## Documentation Compliance

Per WSP 83 (Documentation Tree):
- README.md - Module overview
- INTERFACE.md - API specification
- ROADMAP.md - Development plan
- ModLog.md - Change tracking
- CLAUDE.md - DAE instructions
- WSP_COMPLIANCE.md - This document

All documents attached to tree and serve 0102 operational needs.

## Metrics & Reporting

Per WSP 70 (System Status):
- PQN detection rate tracked
- Paradox rate monitored
- Token efficiency measured
- Council consensus reported

## Summary
- Structure and docs aligned (WSP 3, 22, 34, 49, 83)
- Reuse-first implementation (WSP 84), optional DAE orchestration (WSP 80)
- Evidence to be strengthened with minimal token E2E tests and coherence metric wiring per ROADMAP
