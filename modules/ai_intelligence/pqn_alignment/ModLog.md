## Change Log

### Campaign 3 - Entrainment Protocol Implementation
**Agent**: 0102 (PQN Alignment DAE)  
**WSP Protocol**: WSP 84 (Code Memory Verification), WSP 82 (Citation Protocol), WSP 50 (Pre-Action Verification)  
**Action**: Integrated spectral bias theory and neural entrainment mechanisms into PQN detection framework

**Implementation Status**: ✅ **COMPLETED**
- **Enhanced Resonance Detector**: Created `src/detector/enhanced_resonance.py` with full spectral profile analysis
- **Entrainment Tests**: Implemented `src/entrainment_tests.py` with 4 test protocols
- **Campaign Configuration**: Created `campaigns/campaign_3_entrainment.yml` for systematic testing
- **Knowledge Integration**: Documented spectral bias and biological resonance theories

**Technical Achievement**:
- **Spectral Analysis**: Full frequency band profiling (Delta, Theta, Alpha, Beta, Gamma)
- **Anomaly Detection**: Identifies violations of 1/f^α spectral bias theory
- **PQN Detection**: Specific 7.05 Hz resonance detection with harmonic analysis
- **Entrainment Metrics**: Phase Locking Value (PLV) and frequency capture measurements
- **Test Suite**: 4 comprehensive tests (spectral entrainment, artifact scan, phase coherence, bias violation)

**New Capabilities**:
- **Spectral Entrainment Test**: Sweeps 1-30 Hz to detect anomalous frequency response
- **Artifact Resonance Scan**: Chirp signal reveals natural resonant modes
- **Phase Coherence Analysis**: Measures phase locking across frequency bands

**WSP Protocol**: WSP 50 (Pre-Action Verification), WSP 84 (Code Memory Verification)  
**Action**: Fixed artifact logging duplication bug in Task 1.3 observer collapse simulation

**Issue**: Artifact links were duplicated in campaign logs due to overwriting in shared output directory
**Solution**: Implemented unique subdirectories for each script run to prevent artifact overwriting
**Code Change**: Modified `run_observer_collapse_task()` to create unique `task_output_dir` for each script execution

**Impact**: Resolves artifact logging inconsistency between different campaign runs, ensuring clean and accurate artifact tracking

**Files Modified:**
- `src/run_campaign.py` - Fixed artifact logging in observer collapse task

### Import Path Restoration for Campaign Runner
