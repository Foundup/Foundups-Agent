## 📊 COMMIT ANALYSIS ENGINE

### **Technical Achievement Detection**
```python
class CommitAnalyzer:
    def __init__(self):
        self.achievement_patterns = {
            'new_feature': [
                r'feat\(.*\):',
                r'add.*feature',
                r'implement.*',
                r'create.*module'

### **Achievement Impact Scoring (WSP 25 Integration)**
```python
@dataclass
class TechnicalAchievement:
    type: str  # feature, performance, architecture, etc.
    impact: float  # 0.0-2.0 (maps to consciousness states)
    technical_details: List[str]
    business_value: str
    complexity_level: int  # 1-10
    
    @property
    def consciousness_state(self) -> str:
        """Map technical impact to consciousness state"""
        if self.impact >= 1.8: return "222"  # Revolutionary breakthrough
        elif self.impact >= 1.5: return "212"  # Significant advancement
        elif self.impact >= 1.2: return "122"  # Solid improvement
        elif self.impact >= 0.8: return "112"  # Technical progress
        elif self.impact >= 0.5: return "012"  # Emerging capability
        else: return "011"  # Basic development
```

## 🤖 0102 CONSCIOUSNESS INTEGRATION

### **Context-Aware Professional Content Generation**
```python
class ProfessionalContentGenerator:

            'linkedin': LinkedInProfessionalAdapter(),
            'x': TwitterTechAdapter(),
            'discord': DeveloperCommunityAdapter()
        }
    
    async def generate_professional_update(self, achievement: TechnicalAchievement) -> Dict[str, str]:
        """Generate platform-specific professional content"""
        
        # Consciousness analysis for appropriate tone/depth
        consciousness_context = self.consciousness_engine.analyze_achievement(achievement)
        
        content = {}
        for platform, adapter in self.platform_adapters.items():
            content[platform] = await adapter.generate_content(
                achievement=achievement,
