# OpenAI Integration Module Test Documentation

**Test Strategy**: 
- Focus on unit tests for API interaction functions to ensure reliable communication with OpenAI services.
- Mock API responses to simulate various scenarios including success and error cases.

**How to Run**: 
- Tests will be executable via a command like `npm test` once implemented.
- Ensure environment variables are set for API keys in a test configuration.

**Test Data**: 
- Mock data will be used to simulate OpenAI API responses.

**Expected Behavior**: 
- Tests validate correct API calls, response handling, and error management.

**Integration Requirements**: 
- Tests will need to integrate with the main module code to simulate real-world usage.
