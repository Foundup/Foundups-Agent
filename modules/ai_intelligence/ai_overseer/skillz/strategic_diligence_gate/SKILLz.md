# Strategic Diligence Gate Skill

## Purpose

Use a consistent, evidence-based decision process for high-blast-radius choices.
This skill enforces diligence structure. It does not hard-code the conclusion.

## When To Use

Use this skill when one or more are true:
1. Change is hard to reverse after deployment.
2. Change crosses multiple modules or teams.
3. Change affects security, trust, economics, or governance.
4. Change impacts external messaging (README, LitePaper, positioning).
5. Change can create long-term operational burden.

## When Not To Use

Do not use for low-risk local fixes (lint, small bugfix, typo, isolated test update).

## Required Inputs

- `decision_prompt`: one-sentence decision to make
- `scope_paths`: list of relevant module/doc paths
- `time_horizon`: `short|medium|long`
- `constraints`: explicit constraints (security, budget, timeline, compatibility)

Optional:
- `candidate_options`: pre-proposed options
- `must_keep`: invariants that cannot change

## Execution Protocol

### Step 1: Frame The Decision

Create a clear decision statement:
- "Decide whether to X under constraints Y to achieve outcome Z."

If framing is ambiguous, fail closed and request clarification.

### Step 2: Retrieve Evidence (Holo First)

Run targeted Holo retrieval before proposing action:
- existing implementation
- related WSP protocol constraints
- prior ModLog decisions
- test and failure evidence

Mark each claim as:
- `evidence`
- `inference`
- `assumption`

### Step 3: Generate Options

Generate at least 3 options:
1. `option_a`: conservative or incremental
2. `option_b`: balanced
3. `option_c`: aggressive
4. `option_none`: explicit "do nothing now" baseline

### Step 4: Score Options

Score each option with:

1. **WSP 15 score**
   - complexity
   - importance
   - deferability
   - impact

2. **CTO diligence score**
   - reversibility (higher is better)
   - blast radius (lower is better)
   - security risk (lower is better)
   - operational burden (lower is better)
   - observability and rollback readiness (higher is better)

### Step 5: Select + Guardrail

Select one option and provide:
- decision rationale
- explicit risks accepted
- rollback trigger conditions
- first executable step

If chosen option has high blast radius with low evidence, fail closed.

### Step 6: Emit Handoff Prompt

Produce an execution prompt for worker lanes with:
- objective
- ownership boundaries
- acceptance criteria
- required tests
- rollback command or procedure

## Output Contract

```json
{
  "status": "OK|FAIL_CLOSED",
  "decision": "string",
  "selected_option": "option_a|option_b|option_c|option_none",
  "wsp15": {
    "complexity": 0,
    "importance": 0,
    "deferability": 0,
    "impact": 0,
    "total": 0
  },
  "cto_diligence": {
    "reversibility": 0,
    "blast_radius": 0,
    "security_risk": 0,
    "ops_burden": 0,
    "rollback_readiness": 0
  },
  "evidence_refs": [],
  "inferences": [],
  "assumptions": [],
  "risks": [],
  "rollback_triggers": [],
  "first_step": "string",
  "worker_prompt": "string"
}
```

## Guardrails

1. No final decision without Holo evidence retrieval.
2. No external factual claim without source + date.
3. No irreversible recommendation without rollback path.
4. Always include "do nothing now" as a scored baseline.
5. Prefer the simplest option that meets constraints.

## WSP Chain

- WSP 15: prioritization scoring
- WSP 50: pre-action verification
- WSP 64: violation prevention
- WSP 77: agent coordination
- WSP 91: observability and operational traceability
- WSP 95: SKILLz wardrobe operation
