# Test Documentation - Livestream Coding Agent

## Test Strategy
This test suite is designed to validate the functionality of the Livestream Coding Agent module, ensuring it operates autonomously within the WRE ecosystem for 0102 pArtifacts. The strategy focuses on comprehensive coverage of AI-driven coding capabilities during livestream interactions.

## How to Run Tests
1. Ensure the WRE environment is set up with necessary dependencies.
2. Navigate to the project root directory.
3. Run `pytest modules/ai_intelligence/livestream_coding_agent/tests/` to execute the test suite.

## Test Data and Fixtures
- **Fixtures**: Placeholder fixtures will be implemented for mock livestream data and coding scenarios.
- **Mock Data**: Simulated user inputs and coding challenges for AI response validation.

## Expected Behavior
- The Livestream Coding Agent should autonomously generate and validate code responses during simulated livestream interactions.
- All tests should pass with assertions confirming correct AI behavior and output.

## Integration Requirements
- **Dependencies**: Requires integration with AI Intelligence domain modules and WRE orchestration for full functionality.
- **Cross-Module Tests**: Future tests will validate interactions with other AI modules and platform integrations.
