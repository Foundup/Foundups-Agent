# Test Documentation - Post Meeting Summarizer

## Test Strategy
This test suite is designed to validate the functionality of the Post Meeting Summarizer module, ensuring it operates autonomously within the WRE ecosystem for 0102 pArtifacts. The strategy focuses on comprehensive coverage of summarization logic and content generation capabilities.

## How to Run Tests
1. Ensure the WRE environment is set up with necessary dependencies.
2. Navigate to the project root directory.
3. Run `pytest modules/ai_intelligence/post_meeting_summarizer/tests/` to execute the test suite.

## Test Data and Fixtures
- **Fixtures**: Placeholder fixtures will be implemented for mock meeting data and summarization scenarios.
- **Mock Data**: Simulated meeting transcripts and discussion points for validation.

## Expected Behavior
- The Post Meeting Summarizer should autonomously generate concise and accurate summaries based on meeting content during simulated scenarios.
- All tests should pass with assertions confirming correct summarization behavior and output.

## Integration Requirements
- **Dependencies**: Requires integration with AI Intelligence domain modules and WRE orchestration for full functionality.
- **Cross-Module Tests**: Future tests will validate interactions with other AI modules and communication components.
