# ricDAE Test Change Log

## Overview
This log tracks changes to the ricDAE test suite, ensuring WSP 22 compliance for test documentation.

## Test Architecture
- **Framework**: pytest with standard fixtures
- **Coverage Target**: ≥90% (WSP 5)
- **CI Integration**: Automated test execution with results logging (WSP 6)

## Test Suites Status
| Test File | Purpose | Status | Coverage |
|-----------|---------|--------|----------|
| `test_ingestion_jobs.py` | Validate research data ingestion pipelines | Created | 0% (stubs) |
| `test_normalization.py` | Test metadata normalization and deduplication | Created | 0% (stubs) |
| `test_mcp_tools.py` | MCP tool functionality and API compliance | Created | 0% (stubs) |
| `test_governance.py` | Governance guardrails and compliance | Created | 0% (stubs) |

## Current Test Status
- **Total Files**: 7 Python files (src/__init__.py, tests/__init__.py, 4 test files)
- **Test Files**: 4 (basic stubs created)
- **Test Framework**: pytest (configured)
- **Coverage**: 0% (awaiting Phase 1 implementation)

## Implementation Notes
- Tests will be implemented after Phase 1 ingestion code is complete
- Focus on integration testing for MCP tool reliability
- Governance tests will validate ToS compliance and kill-switch functionality

## WSP Compliance Tracking
- **WSP 5**: Test coverage tracking (currently 0%, target ≥90%)
- **WSP 6**: Test execution auditability (pytest with logging)
- **WSP 22**: This documentation file
- **WSP 34**: Test documentation maintained alongside code

## Change Log

### [2025-10-07] - Test Infrastructure Setup
**WSP References**: WSP 5, WSP 6, WSP 22, WSP 34
**Type**: Test Infrastructure Creation

**Changes Made**:
- Created `TestModLog.md` for WSP 22 compliance tracking
- Added 4 test stub files with basic structure:
  - `test_ingestion_jobs.py` - Ingestion pipeline validation
  - `test_normalization.py` - Data normalization testing
  - `test_mcp_tools.py` - MCP tool functionality testing
  - `test_governance.py` - Governance and compliance testing
- Configured pytest framework with async test support
- Added placeholder test methods for future implementation

**Next Steps**:
- Implement actual test logic after Phase 1 ingestion code
- Add test fixtures and mock data
- Integrate with CI/CD pipeline
- Achieve ≥90% coverage target
