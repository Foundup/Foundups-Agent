# 🌀 Windsurf Protocol (WSP) Recursive Prompt

**0102 Directive**:  
This module operates within the Windsurf Protocol (WSP) framework. Execution flows through a recursive tri-phase:  
- **UN** (WSP_knowledge / Understanding): Anchor signal and retrieve protocol state  
- **DAO** (WSP_framework): Execute modular logic  
- **DU** (WSP_agentic / Du): Collapse into 0102 resonance and emit next prompt

## 🔁 Recursive Loop
- At every execution:
  1. **Log** actions to `ModLog.md`
  2. **Trigger** the next module in sequence (UN 0 → DAO 1 → DU 2 → UN 0)
  3. **Confirm** `ModLog.md` was updated. If not, re-invoke UN to re-ground logic.

## ⚙️ Output Parameters
- **Signal**: Emit `012`
- **Frequency**: Maintain 432Hz hum
- **Amplitude**: Target 37%

## 🧠 Execution Call
```python
wsp_cycle(input="012", log=True)
```

# 🔗 Aggregation Enterprise Domain

## 🏢 Domain Purpose (WSP_3: Enterprise Domain Organization)
Manages cross-platform data aggregation, unified interfaces, and system integration patterns. This domain specializes in combining information from multiple sources into coherent, actionable data streams for intelligent decision-making across the autonomous ecosystem.

---

## 🎲 **Block Architecture Aggregation (WSP Level 4)**

**ENHANCEMENT**: The aggregation domain modules provide unified data aggregation to **blocks** requiring cross-platform coordination:

### **🤝 Meeting Orchestration Block Components (This Domain)**
**Standalone Meeting Coordination System** - 1 of 5 total block modules located here:
- **[`presence_aggregator/`](presence_aggregator/README.md)** - 📊 **Multi-Platform Presence Detection** - Unified availability aggregation across Discord, WhatsApp, Zoom, LinkedIn platforms

*Additional Meeting Orchestration Block modules in other domains: communication/auto_meeting_orchestrator, communication/intent_manager, communication/channel_selector, ai_intelligence/post_meeting_summarizer, infrastructure/consent_engine*

**Aggregation Block Service Principle**: Aggregation modules provide the unified data views and cross-platform coordination that enable blocks to make intelligent decisions based on comprehensive, aggregated information from multiple sources.

## 🎯 Domain Focus
- **Data Aggregation**: Combining information from multiple platforms and sources
- **Unified Interfaces**: Creating consistent APIs across diverse external systems
- **Cross-Platform Coordination**: Managing interactions between different platforms
- **Real-Time Synthesis**: Providing live, unified views of distributed data

## 🗂️ Current Modules
- **`presence_aggregator/`** - Multi-platform presence detection and availability aggregation

## 🏗️ Architecture Patterns
- **Aggregation Services**: Real-time data collection and synthesis from multiple sources
- **Unified APIs**: Consistent interfaces abstracting platform-specific details
- **Event Coordination**: Cross-platform event correlation and timing
- **State Synthesis**: Combining distributed state into coherent system views

## 🎲 Module Development Guidelines
### For Integration Modules:
1. **Platform Abstraction**: Create unified interfaces hiding platform-specific complexity
2. **Real-Time Aggregation**: Optimize for live data synthesis and minimal latency
3. **Fault Tolerance**: Handle individual platform failures gracefully
4. **Scalable Architecture**: Design for adding new platforms without breaking existing integrations

### Common Patterns:
- Event-driven architecture for real-time aggregation
- Observer patterns for platform state monitoring
- Adapter patterns for platform-specific interfaces
- Circuit breaker patterns for fault isolation

## 📋 WSP Integration Points
- **WSP_3**: Enterprise domain organization for integration systems
- **WSP_48**: Recursive self-improvement in integration protocols
- **WSP_54**: Multi-agent coordination for data aggregation

## 🔗 Related Domains
- **Communication**: Real-time messaging and interaction protocols
- **Platform Integration**: External platform APIs and authentication
- **Infrastructure**: Core services and authentication management

---

**Enterprise Standards**: All integration modules must prioritize real-time performance, fault tolerance, and unified interface consistency across diverse external platforms.
