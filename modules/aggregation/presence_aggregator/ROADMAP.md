## 🔧 Technical Architecture Evolution

### PoC Architecture ✅
```
PresenceAggregator (In-Memory) → Simulated Data → Console Output
```

### Prototype Architecture
```
PresenceAggregator → Platform APIs → SQLite Cache → AMO Integration
                  ↓
              OAuth Manager → Token Storage
```

### MVP Architecture
```
                    Load Balancer
                         ↓
              PresenceAggregator Cluster

## 🚨 Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
- **API Rate Limits**: Implement intelligent caching and request batching
- **Platform API Changes**: Version pinning and automated testing
- **Authentication Issues**: Robust token refresh and fallback mechanisms
- **Scale Challenges**: Horizontal scaling architecture from prototype phase

### Business Risks
- **Platform Policy Changes**: Multi-platform strategy reduces single points of failure
- **Privacy Concerns**: User consent and opt-out mechanisms
- **Cost Scaling**: Efficient caching to minimize API costs
- **Competition**: Focus on unique cross-platform aggregation value

## 📝 Dependencies

### External
- Platform APIs (Discord, WhatsApp, LinkedIn, Zoom, Teams, Slack)
- OAuth 2.0 providers
- Database systems (SQLite → PostgreSQL/MySQL)
- Caching systems (Redis for MVP)

### Internal AMO Modules
- Intent Manager (consumes presence data)
- 0102 Orchestrator (uses for conversation context)
- Channel Selector (uses for platform optimization)
- Audit Logger (logs presence events)
