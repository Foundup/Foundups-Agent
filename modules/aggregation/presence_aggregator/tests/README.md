# Test Documentation - Presence Aggregator

## Test Strategy
This test suite is designed to validate the functionality of the Presence Aggregator module, ensuring it operates autonomously within the WRE ecosystem for 0102 pArtifacts. The strategy focuses on comprehensive coverage of presence data aggregation and processing capabilities.

## How to Run Tests
1. Ensure the WRE environment is set up with necessary dependencies.
2. Navigate to the project root directory.
3. Run `pytest modules/aggregation/presence_aggregator/tests/` to execute the test suite.

## Test Data and Fixtures
- **Fixtures**: Placeholder fixtures will be implemented for mock presence data and aggregation scenarios.
- **Mock Data**: Simulated user presence states and aggregation contexts for validation.

## Expected Behavior
- The Presence Aggregator should autonomously collect and process presence data based on predefined rules during simulated scenarios.
- All tests should pass with assertions confirming correct aggregation behavior and output.

## Integration Requirements
- **Dependencies**: Requires integration with Aggregation domain modules and WRE orchestration for full functionality.
- **Cross-Module Tests**: Future tests will validate interactions with other aggregation modules and platform integration components.
