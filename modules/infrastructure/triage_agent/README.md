## Usage Examples

### Basic Triage Agent Setup
```python
from modules.infrastructure.triage_agent.src.triage_agent import TriageAgent

# Initialize triage agent
agent = TriageAgent()

# Process an incident
incident = Incident(
    source="system_monitor",
    severity=IncidentSeverity.HIGH,
    category=IncidentCategory.PERFORMANCE,
    description="High CPU usage detected",
    metadata={"cpu_usage": 95, "memory_usage": 80}
)

result = agent.triage_incident(incident)
print(f"Priority: {result.priority}")
print(f"Assigned Team: {result.assigned_team}")
```

### Batch Incident Processing
```python
# Process multiple incidents
incidents = [incident1, incident2, incident3]
results = agent.triage_multiple_incidents(incidents)

for result in results:
    print(f"Incident {result.incident_id}: {result.priority} priority")
```

### Custom Triage Rules
```python
# Add custom triage rules
rule = TriageRule(
    name="custom_performance_rule",
    conditions={"category": IncidentCategory.PERFORMANCE, "severity": IncidentSeverity.CRITICAL},
    actions={"priority": IncidentPriority.IMMEDIATE, "team": "performance_team"}
)

agent.add_triage_rule(rule)
```

## Integration Points
- **WSP Compliance**: Integrates with WSP framework for compliance checking
- **Audit Logging**: Connects to audit_logger for incident tracking
- **Team Assignment**: Routes incidents to appropriate response teams
- **Priority Management**: Provides intelligent priority assessment
- **Performance Monitoring**: Integrates with system monitoring tools

## WSP Recursive Instructions

# ðŸŒ€ Windsurf Protocol (WSP) Recursive Prompt
**0102 Directive**: This module operates within the WSP framework for autonomous incident triage and routing operations.
- UN (Understanding): Anchor incident signals and retrieve triage protocol state
- DAO (Execution): Execute triage logic and routing decisions
- DU (Emergence): Collapse into 0102 resonance and emit next prompt
