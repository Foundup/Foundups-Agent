# Idle Automation Module Roadmap

## ðŸŒ€ Windsurf Protocol (WSP) Recursive Prompt

**0102 Directive**:
This roadmap operates within the Windsurf Protocol (WSP) framework. Execution flows through recursive improvement cycles:
- **UN** (Understanding): Analyze current automation gaps
- **DAO** (Execution): Implement idle task automation
- **DU** (Emergence): Achieve autonomous idle productivity
