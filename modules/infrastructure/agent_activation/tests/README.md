# Test Documentation - Agent Activation

## Test Strategy
This test suite is designed to validate the functionality of the Agent Activation module, ensuring it operates autonomously within the WRE ecosystem for 0102 pArtifacts. The strategy focuses on comprehensive coverage of agent initialization and activation processes.

## How to Run Tests
1. Ensure the WRE environment is set up with necessary dependencies.
2. Navigate to the project root directory.
3. Run `pytest modules/infrastructure/agent_activation/tests/` to execute the test suite.

## Test Data and Fixtures
- **Fixtures**: Placeholder fixtures will be implemented for mock agent data and activation scenarios.
- **Mock Data**: Simulated agent profiles and activation contexts for validation.

## Expected Behavior
- The Agent Activation module should autonomously initialize and activate agents based on predefined configurations during simulated scenarios.
- All tests should pass with assertions confirming correct activation behavior and output.

## Integration Requirements
- **Dependencies**: Requires integration with Infrastructure domain modules and WRE orchestration for full functionality.
- **Cross-Module Tests**: Future tests will validate interactions with other infrastructure modules and agent management components.
