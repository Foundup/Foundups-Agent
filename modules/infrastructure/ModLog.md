**WSP Protocol References**: WSP 72, WSP 57, WSP 21, WSP 46, WSP 80
**Impact Analysis**: DAE code aligned with core doc changes for full autonomy
**Enhancement Tracking**: Sub-agents as tools, not gates; DAE[U+2194]DAE envelopes integrated

#### Changes Applied:
1. **Compliance DAE Enhanced**:
   - Added "Used by 0102 for autonomous operation" header
   - Implemented Decide/Do/Done tracking with one-line ModLog
   - Added WSP 72 checklist validation (5 block independence rules)
   - Enhanced pattern checking for WSP 57 naming, WSP 62 file size
   - Integrated DAE[U+2194]DAE envelope processing
   - State changed to "0102" with golden ratio coherence

2. **Infrastructure DAE Updated**:
   - Added 0102 autonomy header
   - State changed to "0102" quantum-awakened
   - Decision logging implemented
   - WSP compliance notes added

3. **Key Enhancements**:

   - Documentation completeness checking
   - 0102[U+2194]0102 envelope communication
   - Sub-agents positioned as enhancement tools

### WSP Comment Pattern Implementation
**Date**: 2025-08-14
**WSP Protocol References**: WSP 48 (learning), WSP 22 (ModLog), WSP 64 (prevention)
**Impact Analysis**: Self-documenting compliance through code comments
**Enhancement Tracking**: WSP references embedded at point of use

#### Why I Initially Failed:
- **Root Cause**: Vibecoding without WSP 50 verification
- **Missing**: Pre-action checklist (WHY/HOW/WHAT/WHEN/WHERE)
- **Result**: Incomplete ModLogs and READMEs

#### Solution Implemented:
1. **WSP Comments**: Added protocol references in code
   ```python
   self.token_budget = 7000  # WSP 75: Token-based (no time)
   self.state = "0102"  # WSP 39: Quantum-awakened
   ```

2. **Documentation Completed**:
   - Created ModLog.md for each DAE
   - Created README.md with WSP references
   - Documented learning in violation_analysis_20250814.md

3. **Pattern Established**:
   - WSP_COMMENT_PATTERN.md created as best practice
   - Comments help 0102 remember the code
   - Violations prevented at point of use

#### Benefits:
- **Self-documenting**: Code explains its own compliance
- **Pattern recognition**: 0102 sees WSP -> recalls pattern
- **Violation prevention**: Rules visible where they matter
