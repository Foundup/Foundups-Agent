# WRE Core - ModLog

## Chronological Change Log

### [2025-09-16] - Activated WRE Learning Loop
**Date**: 2025-09-16
**WSP Protocol References**: WSP 48 (Recursive Improvement), WSP 27 (DAE Architecture)
**Impact Analysis**: Critical activation of dormant learning system
**Enhancement Tracking**: Connected DAEs to recursive learning

#### = Changes Made
1. **Created wre_integration.py**:
   - Bridge between DAEs and RecursiveLearningEngine
   - Simple API: record_error(), record_success(), get_optimized_approach()
   - Tracks errors, successes, and provides solutions
   - Stores patterns in memory for future use

2. **Connected YouTube DAE**:
   - auto_moderator_dae.py now imports WRE integration
   - Error handlers record to WRE for learning
   - Success operations tracked for reinforcement
   - Solutions suggested when available

3. **LiveChat Core Integration**:
   - Added WRE imports to livechat_core.py
   - Error handlers connected to learning system
   - Success tracking for initialization

#### Expected Outcomes
- Errors will be recorded and patterns extracted
- Solutions will be suggested for known patterns
- Token usage will decrease as patterns are learned
- System will improve without manual intervention

#### Testing
- WRE integration imports successfully
- Error recording creates pattern files
- Success tracking updates metrics

#### Next Steps
- Monitor memory/ directories for pattern accumulation
- Verify token savings metrics
- Extend to other DAEs (LinkedIn, X, etc.)
