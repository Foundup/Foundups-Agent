# Remote DAE Architecture - Remote Code Execution Cube

## Core Concept: Autonomous Remote Development

The **Remote DAE** is a revolutionary autonomous system that can:
- Execute code on remote systems
- Develop and deploy across distributed infrastructure
- Self-modify and improve code in production environments
- Operate independently across multiple codebases

## 🧊 Remote DAE Cube Structure

### Level -1: Signal Detection
```yaml
Purpose: "Detect remote development opportunities"

## 🔐 Security & Boundaries

### Authentication Layer
```python
class RemoteDAEAuth:
    """Secure authentication for remote operations"""
    
    def __init__(self):
        self.ssh_keys = self._load_ssh_keys()
        self.api_tokens = self._load_api_tokens()
        self.permissions = self._define_boundaries()
    
    def _define_boundaries(self):
        """Define what Remote DAE can and cannot do"""
        return {
            'allowed_repos': [...],  # Whitelist of repos
            'allowed_actions': [
                'read', 'write', 'test', 'pr_create',
                'staging_deploy'  # NOT production by default
            ],
            'forbidden_paths': [
                '/etc', '/system', '.env',
                'credentials', 'secrets'
            ],
            'rate_limits': {
                'commits_per_hour': 10,
                'prs_per_day': 20,
                'deploys_per_day': 5
            }
        }
```

### Safety Protocols
1. **Never modify credentials or secrets**
2. **Always create PRs, never direct commits to main**
3. **Run tests before any deployment**
4. **Maintain audit logs of all actions**
5. **Respect rate limits and quotas**
