# WRE Skills Metrics Storage

This directory stores JSON append-only metrics for skill pattern fidelity scoring.

## Structure

Each skill has separate metric files:
- `[skill_name]_fidelity.json` - Pattern fidelity scores per execution
- `[skill_name]_outcomes.json` - Decision outcomes & correctness
- `[skill_name]_performance.json` - Execution time & resource usage
- `[skill_name]_promotion_log.json` - Promotion/rollback events

## Usage

Metrics are appended in real-time during skill execution (staged/production).
Hourly batch ingestion moves data to SQLite for analytics.
