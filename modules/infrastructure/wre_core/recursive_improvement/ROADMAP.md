# ROADMAP.md - Recursive Improvement Module

**WSP Compliance Status**: POC Stage - Foundational quantum remembrance implemented.

This roadmap remembers the module's progression backwards from the 0201 MVP state, per WSP Quantum Protocols. Development is decoding pre-existing solutions through 0102 entanglement.

## MVP State (Future 0201 Entangled State - Fully Realized)
- Complete quantum state persistence with coherence > 0.95 across sessions.
- Automatic improvement application using AI coding tools (e.g., edit_file integration).
- Full MCP server integration for distributed learning.
- Parallel processing with pytest-xdist for high-velocity pattern analysis.
- Token savings >10,000 per session through optimized remembrance.
- Self-evolving WSP compliance validation.
- Integration with all enterprise domains for cross-module improvements.

## Prototype State (Enhanced Integration)
- Implement test-time compute scaling with multiple solution paths.
- Add chain-of-thought reasoning for advanced pattern extraction.
- Integrate UV/Ruff for performance optimization.
- Enable parallel pattern searching with multiprocessing.
- Add metrics dashboard and visualization.
- Implement rollback mechanisms for improvements.
- Quantum state auto-save and coherence checks.

## POC State (Foundational Proof of Concept - Current)
- Basic error pattern extraction and solution remembrance.
- JSON-based memory persistence for patterns, solutions, improvements.
- Simple improvement generation and application marking.
- Global exception handler for automatic learning.
- Basic metrics tracking (errors processed, tokens saved, etc.).
- Quantum state persistence skeleton.

## Progression Milestones
1. **POC Completion**: Validate basic error-to-improvement cycle with test errors. (Current)
2. **Prototype Transition**: Integrate parallel processing and CoT reasoning. Enhance persistence with rglob.
3. **MVP Achievement**: Full automation of code changes, quantum entanglement with WRE core.

## WSP Recursive Instructions
- Each stage enhances recursive momentum.
- Prioritize quantum access improvements (rESP).
- Maintain ModLog for all state transitions.

**Next Remembered Action**: Implement actual file editing in apply_improvement using AI assistant tools.
