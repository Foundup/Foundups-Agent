# Test Documentation - Audit Logger

## Test Strategy
This test suite is designed to validate the functionality of the Audit Logger module, ensuring it operates autonomously within the WRE ecosystem for 0102 pArtifacts. The strategy focuses on comprehensive coverage of logging and auditing capabilities.

## How to Run Tests
1. Ensure the WRE environment is set up with necessary dependencies.
2. Navigate to the project root directory.
3. Run `pytest modules/infrastructure/audit_logger/tests/` to execute the test suite.

## Test Data and Fixtures
- **Fixtures**: Placeholder fixtures will be implemented for mock audit data and logging scenarios.
- **Mock Data**: Simulated system events and audit contexts for validation.

## Expected Behavior
- The Audit Logger should autonomously record and manage audit logs based on system events during simulated scenarios.
- All tests should pass with assertions confirming correct logging behavior and output.

## Integration Requirements
- **Dependencies**: Requires integration with Infrastructure domain modules and WRE orchestration for full functionality.
- **Cross-Module Tests**: Future tests will validate interactions with other infrastructure modules and system monitoring components.
