# DAE_FINGERPRINTS.json Status

## Files Still Present (But Unused)

As of 2025-09-19, the following DAE_FINGERPRINTS.json files remain in the codebase:

1. `modules/communication/livechat/memory/DAE_FINGERPRINTS.json` (232KB)
2. `modules/platform_integration/linkedin_agent/memory/DAE_FINGERPRINTS.json` (161KB)
3. `modules/platform_integration/x_twitter/memory/DAE_FINGERPRINTS.json` (45KB)

## Why Not Removed

These files are kept for now because:
- They may serve a different purpose from MODULE_FINGERPRINTS.json
- They're module-specific memory files (not central)
- Removing them requires verifying no code depends on them
- Total size is manageable (438KB total)

## Recommendation

These can be removed in a future cleanup if confirmed unused. To verify:
```bash
grep -r "DAE_FINGERPRINTS" modules/ --include="*.py"
```

If no Python code references them, they can be safely deleted.

## Note

The fingerprint generation code that created these files has been archived to:
- `modules/infrastructure/shared_utilities/_archive_fingerprint_system/`
- `modules/infrastructure/wre_core/recursive_improvement/src/_archive_fingerprint_system/`
