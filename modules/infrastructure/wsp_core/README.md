# WSP Core Module

## Overview
Core WSP (Wisdom State Protocols) implementation infrastructure providing foundational protocol enforcement and validation across the system.

## Purpose
This module contains the core WSP protocol engine that ensures all system components adhere to the established Wisdom State Protocols.

## Components

### Core Implementation (`src/`)
- WSP protocol validation engine
- Protocol enforcement mechanisms
- Cross-module WSP compliance checking

### Memory (`memory/`)
- WSP pattern storage and recall
- Protocol violation history
- Learning patterns for recursive improvement

## WSP Compliance
This module follows:
- **WSP 49**: Module Directory Structure Standardization
- **WSP 50**: Pre-Action Verification Protocol
- **WSP 64**: Violation Prevention System
- **WSP 48**: Recursive Self-Improvement

## Integration
Core dependency for all WSP-compliant modules across the system.

## Status
Active - Core Infrastructure Component
