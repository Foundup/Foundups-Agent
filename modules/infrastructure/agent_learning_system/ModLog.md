## MODLOG ENTRIES

### [2025-01-10] - WSP-Compliant Module Structure Creation
**Agent**: Claude (Module Scaffolding Agent)  
**Reason**: WSP 49 compliance - proper module directory structure  
**Changes**:
- Moved demonstration_learner.py from root to src/
- Created proper __init__.py files with full exports
- Added comprehensive README.md with WSP 48/54 documentation
- Created INTERFACE.md with complete API specification  
- Added ROADMAP.md with 4-phase development plan
- Established tests/ directory with comprehensive test coverage
- Added requirements.txt with core and optional dependencies
- Created memory/ directory structure per WSP 60
- Added proper ModLog.md (this file) per WSP 22

**Files Added**:
- `__init__.py` - Module exports and metadata
- `src/__init__.py` - Source package initialization
- `README.md` - Comprehensive module documentation
- `INTERFACE.md` - API specification and data structures
- `ROADMAP.md` - 4-phase development roadmap
- `ModLog.md` - This change log file
- `tests/__init__.py` - Test package initialization  
- `tests/test_demonstration_learner.py` - Core functionality tests
- `requirements.txt` - Module dependencies
- `memory/README.md` - WSP 60 memory architecture docs

**Files Moved**:
- `demonstration_learner.py` → `src/demonstration_learner.py`

**WSP Compliance Achieved**:

- Implemented pattern detection and extraction
- Added observation recording and completion
- Created pattern library management
- Added agent teaching capabilities
- Implemented learning metrics and reporting

**Core Features Implemented**:
- DemonstrationLearner class with full functionality
- Real-time pattern detection during demonstrations
- Pattern categorization (code, workflow, fix, documentation)
- Memory persistence with JSON storage
- Agent knowledge transfer system
- Acceleration factor calculation
- Global learner instance management

**Pattern Types Supported**:
- Error handling addition patterns
- Import addition patterns  
- Function and class creation patterns
- WSP compliance patterns
- Git workflow patterns
- Test execution patterns
- Module structure patterns
- Documentation patterns
