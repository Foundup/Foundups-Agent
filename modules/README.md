# FoundUps Agent Modules - The FoundUp Engine

## [ROCKET] **The FoundUp Engine: Building Autonomous FoundUps**

**FoundUps is the engine that builds FoundUps.** Each module becomes a social media agent for a 012 launching their own FoundUp. We are building the autonomous development engine that allows anyone to launch and build their own FoundUp - **a fully autonomous company that runs itself.**

## [U+1F3B2] **Block Architecture: Rubik's Cube Within Cube Framework**

**NEW CONCEPT:** **Blocks** are collections of modules that form standalone, independent units following WSP Rubik's cube within cube framework. Every block can run independently within the system while plugging seamlessly into the WRE ecosystem.

### **[U+1F300] WSP 4-Level Architecture:**
```
[U+1F3B2] LEVEL 1: Enterprise System (FoundUps Platform)
[U+1F3B2] LEVEL 2: Enterprise Domains (platform_integration/, communication/, etc.)  
[U+1F3B2] LEVEL 3: Modules (Individual LEGO pieces)
[U+1F3B2] LEVEL 4: BLOCKS (Standalone Module Collections) <- NEW LEVEL
```

**Key WSP Principle:** Every block is a collection of modules that make it functional and every block can run independently within the system.

## [U+1F3B2] **WSP Block Architecture Compliance**

### **Functional Distribution Principles (WSP 3)**
**[OK] CORRECT Approach:** Modules distributed by **function** across enterprise domains
- **Communication modules** handle messaging protocols (work for YouTube, Discord, LinkedIn)
- **Platform Integration modules** manage external APIs (YouTube, X, LinkedIn specific)
- **AI Intelligence modules** provide cognitive capabilities (universal across platforms)
- **Infrastructure modules** provide core system services (authentication, management)

**[FAIL] ANTI-PATTERN:** Never consolidate all platform functionality into platform-specific domains
- Never create `modules/youtube/` containing all YouTube functionality
- Never create `modules/linkedin/` containing all LinkedIn functionality  
- Platform functionality MUST be distributed functionally across domains

### **Block Independence Requirements**
- **[U+1F50C] Standalone Operation:** Each block functions independently without requiring other blocks
- **[LIGHTNING] Clean Interfaces:** Standard WSP-compliant APIs for seamless inter-block communication
- **[REFRESH] Hot-Swappable Design:** Blocks can be upgraded, replaced, or removed without system disruption
- **[TARGET] Domain-Focused Purpose:** Laser-focused scope with clear responsibility boundaries
- **[U+1F6E1]️ Graceful Degradation:** Block failures don't cascade to other blocks or the system

### **Rubik's Cube Integration**
- **[U+1F3B2] Level 4 Architecture:** Blocks represent the highest level of modular organization
- **[LINK] Snap-Together Design:** Blocks connect through well-defined WSP interface standards
- **[U+1F30A] Recursive Enhancement:** Each block success accelerates development of next blocks
- **[U+2699]️ WRE Orchestration:** All blocks integrate seamlessly with Windsurf Recursive Engine
