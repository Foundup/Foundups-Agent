# FoundUps Module Blocks - Strategic Roadmap

## 🎲 **Block Architecture: Rubik's Cube Within Cube Framework**

**Block Definition:** A **block** is a collection of modules that forms a standalone, independent unit that can run independently within the system while plugging seamlessly into the WRE ecosystem.

### **🌀 WSP Rubik's Cube Architecture**
Following WSP 3 Enterprise Domain Organization, blocks represent the fourth architectural level:

```
🎲 LEVEL 1: Enterprise System (FoundUps Platform)
├── WRE Core, Infrastructure, AI Intelligence, Communication, etc.

🎲 LEVEL 2: Enterprise Domains  
├── platform_integration/, communication/, ai_intelligence/, infrastructure/

🎲 LEVEL 3: Modules (Individual LEGO pieces)
├── youtube_auth/, livechat/, banter_engine/, oauth_management/

🎲 LEVEL 4: BLOCKS (Standalone Module Collections)
├── YouTube Block, Remote Builder Block, X Block, LinkedIn Block, Meeting Block
```

**Key Principle:** Every block is a collection of modules that make it functional and every block can run independently within the system - this is WSP.
