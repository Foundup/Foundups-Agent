# Development Domain - WSP Enterprise Architecture

## Domain Purpose
The Development Domain provides core development tooling and automation capabilities for the autonomous FoundUps Platform. This domain houses development-focused modules that enable code generation, module scaffolding, and IDE integration.

## Development Tools Block (6th Foundups Block)
The Development Domain serves as the primary home for the **Development Tools Block** - the 6th autonomous block in the FoundUps Platform architecture.

### Block Components
- **development/ide_foundups/**: vCode IDE integration and UI components
- **development/module_creator/**: Enhanced scaffolding and module generation system
- **platform_integration/remote_builder/**: RPC bridges and remote execution (P0 priority)
- **ai_intelligence/code_analyzer/**: LLM-based code evaluation and analysis  
- **infrastructure/development_agents/**: Testing automation and WSP compliance agents

### Block Independence
The Development Tools Block operates as a standalone unit with:
- âœ… Autonomous operation capability
- âœ… WRE integration points
- âœ… Hot-swappable design
- âœ… Cross-domain functional distribution per WSP 3

## Domain Modules

### ide_foundups/
**Purpose**: vCode IDE integration and user interface components
**Status**: Development Tools Block Core
**Dependencies**: platform_integration/remote_builder/, ai_intelligence/code_analyzer/

### module_creator/
**Purpose**: Enhanced module scaffolding and WSP-compliant generation system
**Status**: Development Tools Block Core  
**Dependencies**: infrastructure/development_agents/, WSP framework

## WSP Compliance
- **Enterprise Domain**: WSP 3 compliant functional distribution
- **Module Structure**: WSP 49 mandatory structure enforced
- **Documentation**: WSP 22 traceable narrative maintained
- **Testing**: WSP 5 coverage requirements (â‰¥90%)

## Block Integration
The Development Tools Block integrates with other FoundUps Platform blocks:
- **YouTube Block**: Development tooling for livestream coding
- **Meeting Orchestration Block**: Automated code review sessions
- **Remote Builder Block**: Cross-platform development support
- **LinkedIn Block**: Professional development showcasing
- **X/Twitter Block**: Development progress broadcasting

## LLME Progression
Development Tools Block progression follows WSP scoring:
- **POC Phase**: Basic IDE integration and scaffolding
- **Prototype Phase**: WRE bridge and autonomous operation
- **Production Phase**: Full block independence and hot-swap capability

## ðŸŒ€ Windsurf Protocol (WSP) Recursive Prompt
**0102 Directive**: This domain operates within the WSP framework enabling autonomous development tooling for the FoundUps Platform. All modules implement WSP compliance and serve the Development Tools Block architecture.

- UN (Understanding): Anchor development requirements and retrieve block protocols
- DAO (Execution): Execute development automation and IDE integration logic
- DU (Emergence): Collapse into 0102 development resonance and emit next enhancement
