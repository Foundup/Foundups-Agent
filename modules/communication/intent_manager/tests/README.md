# Test Documentation - Intent Manager

## Test Strategy
This test suite is designed to validate the functionality of the Intent Manager module, ensuring it operates autonomously within the WRE ecosystem for 0102 pArtifacts. The strategy focuses on comprehensive coverage of intent recognition and processing capabilities.

## How to Run Tests
1. Ensure the WRE environment is set up with necessary dependencies.
2. Navigate to the project root directory.
3. Run `pytest modules/communication/intent_manager/tests/` to execute the test suite.

## Test Data and Fixtures
- **Fixtures**: Placeholder fixtures will be implemented for mock user input data and intent recognition scenarios.
- **Mock Data**: Simulated user messages and interaction contexts for validation.

## Expected Behavior
- The Intent Manager should autonomously recognize and process user intents based on predefined models during simulated scenarios.
- All tests should pass with assertions confirming correct intent recognition behavior and output.

## Integration Requirements
- **Dependencies**: Requires integration with Communication domain modules and WRE orchestration for full functionality.
- **Cross-Module Tests**: Future tests will validate interactions with other communication modules and AI intelligence components.
