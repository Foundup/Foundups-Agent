## 🎨 Visual Prompt Templates

### Template 1: Discovery/Reveal
```
Structure: Wide shot → Slow pan → Close-up reveal → Satisfying detail
Example: "A narrow Tokyo alley at dusk, camera slowly panning to reveal a
hidden ramen shop with steam rising from bowls, warm yellow light spilling
onto wet pavement, a satisfied customer slurping noodles through the window"
```

### Template 2: POV Experience
```
Structure: First-person view → Natural movement → Surprising element
Example: "POV walking through a bamboo forest in Arashiyama, shafts of
golden sunlight filtering through towering stalks, camera tilts up to reveal
the canopy swaying in gentle wind, a hidden shrine appears in the distance"
```

### Template 3: Cultural Moment
```
Structure: Everyday scene → Uniquely Japanese detail → Emotional payoff
Example: "A salary worker feeds coins into a vending machine at midnight,
camera zooms to show 20+ drink options including hot coffee, he smiles as
warm can dispenses, steam rising in the cold Tokyo night"
```

### Template 4: Nature + Culture Blend
```
Structure: Natural beauty → Human element → Harmonious integration
Example: "Cherry blossom petals drift across a traditional wooden bridge
in Kyoto, a woman in kimono pauses to look at the reflection in the pond
below, camera pulls back to reveal the entire scene bathed in soft pink light"
```

## 🌟 Example Perfect Prompts

### Example 1: Food Discovery
```
A steaming bowl of tonkotsu ramen emerges from kitchen steam in a tiny
Osaka shop, camera slowly circles the bowl showing perfectly cooked chashu
pork, soft-boiled egg, and green onions, a pair of chopsticks lifts noodles
in slow motion, warm golden lighting, the chef smiles proudly in the background
```

**Why it works**:
- ✅ Specific dish (tonkotsu ramen)
- ✅ Real location (Osaka)
- ✅ Sensory details (steam, golden lighting)
- ✅ Human element (chef's pride)
- ✅ Dynamic camera movement

### Example 2: Urban Discovery
```
A neon-lit Tokyo street at night reflects in rain puddles, camera low angle
following footsteps past vending machines and izakaya doorways, suddenly pans
up to reveal Shibuya crossing's massive LED screens, hundreds of people cross
in perfect synchronized chaos, a single person stops to look up in wonder
```

**Why it works**:
- ✅ Iconic location (Shibuya)
- ✅ POV perspective (following footsteps)
- ✅ Atmospheric (rain, neon)
- ✅ Scale reveal (ground → massive screens)
- ✅ Human moment (person in wonder)

### Example 3: Nature Serenity
```
Early morning mist rises over a traditional ryokan garden in Hakone, camera
glides over perfectly raked gravel patterns and moss-covered stones, a koi
fish creates ripples in the pond, Mount Fuji appears through the mist in
perfect symmetry, soft golden sunrise light bathes everything in warmth
```

**Why it works**:
- ✅ Peaceful atmosphere (mist, morning)
- ✅ Cultural detail (ryokan, gravel patterns)
- ✅ Natural beauty (koi, moss, Mt. Fuji)
- ✅ Satisfying composition (symmetry)
- ✅ Emotional payoff (warmth, beauty)

### Example 4: Everyday Magic
```
A tired salary worker drops coins into a late-night vending machine, camera
zooms to show the incredible variety: hot corn soup, iced coffee, energy drinks,
even hot noodles, a warm can clanks down, steam rises when opened, the person's
face lights up with simple joy, Tokyo skyline glows softly behind them
```

**Why it works**:
- ✅ Relatable character (tired worker)
- ✅ Uniquely Japanese (amazing vending machines)
- ✅ Sensory moments (steam, glow)
- ✅ Emotional arc (tired → joy)
- ✅ Cultural authenticity (salary worker culture)
