# WSP Violations Log - moltbot_bridge

## 2026-02-07: WSP 95/71 Security Audit - CLEAN

**Auditor**: 0102
**WSP**: 71, 95, 96
**Status**: NO VIOLATIONS

### Audit Scope
Mutating DAE entrypoints checked for scanner gate parity with WSP 95/96 requirements:
- Required mode fail-closed
- Enforced severity threshold
- TTL-bounded cache
- Auditable decision logs

### Findings

**All routes properly gated.** The skill safety gate in `openclaw_dae.py` covers:

| Intent Category | Gate Required | Gate Present | Status |
|-----------------|---------------|--------------|--------|
| COMMAND         | Yes           | Yes          | PASS   |
| SYSTEM          | Yes           | Yes          | PASS   |
| SCHEDULE        | Yes           | Yes          | PASS   |
| SOCIAL          | Yes           | Yes          | PASS   |
| AUTOMATION      | Yes           | Yes          | PASS   |
| FOUNDUP         | Yes           | Yes          | PASS   |
| QUERY           | No (read-only)| N/A          | N/A    |
| MONITOR         | No (read-only)| N/A          | N/A    |
| CONVERSATION    | No (LLM-only) | N/A          | N/A    |

### Architecture Validation

1. **Single entry point**: All skill-driven routes go through `OpenClawDAE.process()`
2. **Gate enforcement**: `_ensure_skill_safety()` called before any mutating route
3. **Downstream coverage**: `fam_adapter.py` and `auto_moderator_bridge.py` are only invoked from `openclaw_dae.py` after gate check
4. **Fail-closed**: Scanner unavailable + required mode = route blocked (WSP 95)
5. **Severity threshold**: Configurable via `OPENCLAW_SKILL_SCAN_MAX_SEVERITY` (default: medium)
6. **TTL cache**: Configurable via `OPENCLAW_SKILL_SCAN_TTL_SEC` (default: 300s)

### Test Coverage

14 tests in `tests/test_skill_safety_guard.py`:
- 7 unit tests for `run_skill_scan()` function
- 7 integration tests for OpenClaw DAE safety gate

All tests passing as of 2026-02-07.
