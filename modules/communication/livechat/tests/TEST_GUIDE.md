# YouTube Agent System - Systematic Test Guide

## 🎯 TEST PROTOCOL: PoC → Prototype → MVP

### Prerequisites
1. Bot must be running: `python main.py` → Option 1
2. You must be in a live YouTube stream chat
3. Have mod permissions for full testing

---

## 📋 PHASE 1: PoC TESTING (Basic Functionality)

### 1.1 AUTO-CAPTURE TEST ✅
**Test:** Send any message in chat
**Expected:** 
- Bot captures your user ID
- Assigns role (OWNER/MOD/MEMBER/USER)
- Gives XP bonus (Owner: 1000, Mod: 500, Member: 100)
**Commands to test:**
```
Regular message: "Hello"
Check capture: /score
```

### 1.2 BASIC COMMANDS TEST 
**Test these commands in chat:**
```
/score     → Shows your XP and level
/rank      → Shows your position on leaderboard  
/level     → Shows progress bar to next level
/points    → Shows point breakdown
/help      → Shows available commands
```

### 1.3 WHACK-A-MAGA TEST 🔨
**Test:** Send MAGA/Trump keywords
```
Test messages:
"MAGA 2024"
"Trump is great"
"I love Trump"
```
**Expected:**
- Bot detects MAGA keywords
- Sends troll response
- Issues 10-second timeout
- Awards points to moderator

### 1.4 MOD TIMEOUT SCORING
**As Moderator, test:**
```
/timeout @username 60     → 60 second timeout
/timeout @username 300    → 5 minute timeout
/timeout @username 600    → 10 minute timeout
```
**Expected:**
- Timeout executed
- Points awarded based on duration
- Anti-gaming rules apply

### 1.5 EMOJI SEQUENCE TEST
**Test these sequences:**
```
✊✊✊     → 000 consciousness (blocked)
✊✊✋     → 001 emergence
✊✋✋     → 011 formation
✋✋✋     → 111 DAO (triggers response)
✋✋🖐️    → 112 resonance
✋🖐️🖐️   → 122 yielding
🖐️🖐️🖐️  → 222 full entanglement
```
**Expected:** BanterEngine responds based on consciousness level

## 📋 PHASE 2: PROTOTYPE TESTING (Enhanced Features)

### 2.1 RPG COMMANDS TEST
```
/stats        → D&D character sheet
/class        → View/choose character class
/achievements → List earned achievements
/leaderboard  → Top 10 players
/daily        → Claim daily bonus
/quest        → View daily quests
```

### 2.2 ACHIEVEMENT TRIGGERS
**Test these actions:**
- First timeout → "First Blood" achievement
- 10 timeouts → "Decimator" achievement  
- 5 timeouts in 60 seconds → "Speed Demon"
- Help 2 members → Helper achievement

### 2.3 ANTI-GAMING MECHANICS
**Test rapid timeouts:**
1. Timeout same user twice → Reduced points
2. Spam 10-second timeouts → No points after 5
3. Timeout 50+ users in one day → Soft cap

### 2.4 DATABASE PERSISTENCE
1. Note your current XP: `/score`
2. Restart the bot (Ctrl+C, restart)
3. Check XP again: `/score`
**Expected:** XP persists across sessions

### 2.5 LEADERBOARD COMPETITION
```
/leaderboard      → View top 10
/leaderboard 25   → View top 25
```
**Test:** Multiple users gain XP, verify ranking updates

---

## 📋 PHASE 3: INTEGRATION TESTING

### 3.1 AUTO-MODERATION
**Test spam detection:**
```
Send 6 messages in 30 seconds
Send identical message 3 times
Use multiple MAGA keywords
```
**Expected:** Escalating timeouts

### 3.2 GIFT/SUPERCHAT DETECTION
**Test:** Send Super Chat or gift membership
**Expected:** 
- Instant response
- Bonus XP for gifter
- Special acknowledgment

### 3.3 QUIZ SYSTEM
```
/quiz     → Get fascism awareness question
/facts    → Get 1933 parallel fact
/fscale   → F-scale personality test
```

### 3.4 PARTY SYSTEM (Prototype)
```
/party create "Anti-Fascist Squad"
/party invite @username
/party raid
```

## 🔍 MONITORING & LOGS

### Check Live Logs
**Log Location:** `modules/communication/livechat/memory/chat_logs/live_chat_debug.log`

### Database Inspection
**Database:** `modules/communication/chat_rules/data/chat_rules.db`

**SQL Queries to check:**
```sql
-- View all captured users
SELECT * FROM moderators ORDER BY total_points DESC;

-- View timeout history
SELECT * FROM timeout_history ORDER BY timestamp DESC;

-- View achievements
SELECT * FROM achievements;

-- Check cooldowns
SELECT * FROM cooldowns WHERE expires_at > datetime('now');
```

### Error Patterns to Watch
1. **Unicode Errors** - Expected on Windows, bot continues
2. **Rate Limiting** - 60 requests/minute max
3. **Quota Exceeded** - Switches to next credential set
4. **Connection Timeouts** - Auto-reconnects
