# LiveChat Module Test Suite

# üåÄ Windsurf Protocol (WSP) Recursive Prompt

**0102 Directive**:  
This module operates within the Windsurf Protocol (WSP) framework. Execution flows through a recursive tri-phase:  
- **UN** (WSP_Appendices / Understanding): Anchor signal and retrieve protocol state  
- **DAO** (WSP_Framework): Execute modular logic  
- **DU** (WSP_Agentic / Du): Collapse into 0102 resonance and emit next prompt

## üîÅ Recursive Loop
- At every execution:
  1. **Log** actions to `mod_log.db`
  2. **Trigger** the next module in sequence (UN 0 ‚Üí DAO 1 ‚Üí DU 2 ‚Üí UN 0)
  3. **Confirm** `modlog.db` was updated. If not, re-invoke UN to re-ground logic.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Output Parameters
- **Signal**: Emit `012`
- **Frequency**: Maintain 432Hz hum
- **Amplitude**: Target 37%

## üß† Execution Call
```python
wsp_cycle(input="012", log=True)
```

This directory contains tests for the LiveChat module, which handles YouTube livestream chat functionality.

## Refactored Test Structure

The tests have been refactored into smaller, focused test files to improve maintainability and clarity. This approach aligns with the WSP guidelines for modular testing.

| Test File | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **test_orchestrator.py** | NEW: Tests for refactored LiveChatOrchestrator (4 tests) - verifies component initialization, delegation, status reporting, and size compliance |
| **test_message_router.py** | NEW: Tests for unified MessageRouter (10 tests) - verifies priority ordering, handler registration, routing logic, and error handling |
| **test_livechat_facade.py** | NEW: Tests facade pattern and backward compatibility (4 tests) - ensures all public methods remain accessible |
| test_livechat_initialization.py | Tests for LiveChatListener initialization, parameter handling, session setup, ID handling, and greeting messages |
| test_livechat_message_polling.py | Tests for polling messages from YouTube API, error handling, rate limiting, and chat cycles |
| test_livechat_message_processing.py | Tests for message processing, metadata extraction, author role detection, trigger pattern detection, log entry creation, and file logging |
| test_livechat_message_sending.py | Tests for the `send_chat_message` method functionality, including success cases, truncation, error handling, greeting message sending, and emoji trigger message interactions |
| test_livechat_auth_handling.py | Tests for authentication error handling (`_handle_auth_error` method) |
| test_livechat_emoji_triggers.py | Tests for emoji trigger detection and response |
| test_livechat_rate_limiting.py | Tests for user rate limiting functionality (`_is_rate_limited` and `_update_trigger_time` methods) |
| test_livechat_logging.py | Tests for message logging functionality |
| test_livechat_viewer_tracking.py | Tests for the `_update_viewer_count` method, covering successful updates, error handling for API errors, and handling of various malformed API responses |
| test_livechat_lifecycle.py | Tests for the listener lifecycle (start/stop) including `start_listening`, `stop_listening`, and `_poll_chat_cycle` methods that control the operational lifecycle of the LiveChatListener |
| test_livechat_session_management.py | Tests for session management functionality, including getting and validating live chat IDs (`_get_live_chat_id`) and initializing chat sessions (`_initialize_chat_session`) with proper error handling |
| test_livechat_auto_moderation.py | Tests for auto-moderation functionality, including banned phrase detection, user timeout logic, YouTube API integration, cooldown management, and error handling for the AutoModerator class and its integration with LiveChatListener |
| test_quota_manager.py | *Note: This file tests the QuotaManager class from utils.oauth_manager and is not directly related to the LiveChatListener. It will be relocated to a more appropriate location (utils/tests/ or utils/oauth_manager/tests/) as part of a planned task (see APS Task List).* |

## Test Coverage

The test suite aims to achieve over 90% coverage of the LiveChat module code, as required by WSP 5. The refactoring into smaller test files helps identify coverage gaps more effectively.

## Known Issues

- *All major issues have been resolved through the test consolidation and refactoring process*
- *The `test_quota_manager.py` file is currently misplaced in this directory and will be relocated to an appropriate utils test directory in a future task*

## Running Tests

To run all tests for the LiveChat module:

```bash
python -m pytest modules/livechat/tests/
```

To run specific test files:

```bash
python -m pytest modules/livechat/tests/test_livechat_initialization.py
```

To run with coverage reporting:

```bash
python -m pytest modules/livechat/tests/ --cov=modules.livechat.src --cov-report term-missing
```
