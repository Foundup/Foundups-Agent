# Livechat Module - Roadmap

## Overview
This module operates within the **communication** enterprise domain following WSP protocols for modular architecture, testing, and documentation compliance.

**WSP Compliance Framework**:
- **WSP 1-13**: Core WSP framework adherence
- **WSP 3**: Communication domain enterprise organization  
- **WSP 4**: FMAS audit compliance
- **WSP 5**: [GREATER_EQUAL]90% test coverage maintained
- **WSP 22**: Module roadmap and ModLog maintenance (PoC->Prototype->MVP)
- **WSP 60**: Module memory architecture compliance

## [ROCKET] Development Roadmap (WSP 22 Compliant)

### Sprint Plan (Voice STT + WSP 62 Refactor)
Sprint 0 - Size audit and refactor plan
- Record WSP 62 violations: auto_moderator_dae.py, message_processor.py, livechat_core.py,
  intelligent_throttle_manager.py, command_handler.py, community_monitor.py
- Define split targets and ownership for each oversized file

Sprint 1 - Voice STT command injection
- Consume CommandEvent from voice_command_ingestion
- Build synthetic livechat message payload for command routing
- Route via MessageProcessor or MessageRouter (no new orchestrator)

Sprint 2 - Routing parity tests
- Add tests to prove voice commands hit the same command paths as chat
- Verify throttling, flood detection, and command cooldown rules

Sprint 3 - Oversized file refactor (phase 1)
- Extract cohesive submodules from auto_moderator_dae.py and message_processor.py
- Preserve public interfaces and keep behavior stable
