# Patent Specification: Autonomous Meeting Orchestration System

**Patent Title:** Method and System for Intent-Driven Autonomous Meeting Orchestration with Anti-Gaming Reputation Management

---

## üéØ **FIELD OF INVENTION**

This invention relates to autonomous meeting coordination systems, specifically to methods for intelligently matching participants based on mutual intent validation, reputation scoring, and cross-platform presence aggregation.

---

## üîç **BACKGROUND**

Current meeting coordination systems suffer from:
- **Spam and low-quality requests** due to lack of intent validation
- **Gaming of importance ratings** without integrity checking
- **Manual scheduling overhead** requiring human intervention
- **Platform fragmentation** with no unified presence detection
- **Context loss** between request and actual meeting

Existing solutions like Calendly, When2meet, and Doodle are **reactive scheduling tools** that lack:
- ‚úÖ **Proactive intent validation**
- ‚úÖ **Anti-gaming reputation systems** 
- ‚úÖ **Autonomous cross-platform orchestration**
- ‚úÖ **Mutual importance assessment**

        assert scope in valid_scopes
        self.update_user_preference(user_id, 'availability_scope', scope)
```

#### **Step 2: Structured Intent Declaration**
```python
class IntentValidator:
    def validate_meeting_request(self, requester_data: dict) -> bool:
        """
