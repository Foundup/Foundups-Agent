# AMO Development Roadmap

**Autonomous Meeting Orchestrator - Strategic Development Plan**

## 🎯 Vision & Mission

**Vision:** Transform meeting coordination from manual scheduling friction into seamless, context-aware orchestration.

**Mission:** Enable emergent meeting coordination where meetings happen naturally when context is clear and both parties are available.
