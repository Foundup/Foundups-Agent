# Test Documentation - Auto Meeting Orchestrator

## Test Strategy
This test suite is designed to validate the functionality of the Auto Meeting Orchestrator module, ensuring it operates autonomously within the WRE ecosystem for 0102 pArtifacts. The strategy focuses on comprehensive coverage of meeting scheduling and orchestration capabilities.

## How to Run Tests
1. Ensure the WRE environment is set up with necessary dependencies.
2. Navigate to the project root directory.
3. Run `pytest modules/communication/auto_meeting_orchestrator/tests/` to execute the test suite.

## Test Data and Fixtures
- **Fixtures**: Placeholder fixtures will be implemented for mock meeting data and orchestration scenarios.
- **Mock Data**: Simulated meeting requests and scheduling contexts for validation.

## Expected Behavior
- The Auto Meeting Orchestrator should autonomously schedule and manage meetings based on predefined criteria during simulated scenarios.
- All tests should pass with assertions confirming correct orchestration behavior and output.

## Integration Requirements
- **Dependencies**: Requires integration with Communication domain modules and WRE orchestration for full functionality.
- **Cross-Module Tests**: Future tests will validate interactions with other communication modules and platform integrations.
