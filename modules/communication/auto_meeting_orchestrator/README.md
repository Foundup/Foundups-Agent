## 🧩 Communication LEGO Block Architecture
The Autonomous Meeting Orchestrator operates as a **self-contained communication LEGO block** within the FoundUps Rubik's Cube module system. It exemplifies perfect modularity by handling all meeting orchestration independently while snapping seamlessly with presence detection, calendar management, and notification modules.

**Communication LEGO Block Principles:**
- **🎯 Meeting-Focused**: Laser-focused solely on meeting orchestration within communication domain
- **🔌 Presence Integration**: Snaps cleanly with platform presence detection modules  
- **⚡ Autonomous Orchestration**: Complete meeting coordination without external module dependencies
- **🔗 Cross-Platform APIs**: Standard interfaces for calendar, notification, and presence modules
- **🔄 Hot-Swappable Coordination**: Can be upgraded while maintaining integration with other modules
- **🎭 Zero Duplication**: Orchestrates existing modules rather than duplicating their functionality

## 🎯 Vision

Transform meeting coordination from manual scheduling friction into seamless, context-aware orchestration. When both parties are available and context is clear, meetings happen automatically.

**Core Philosophy:** *Intent + Context + Presence + Priority + Consent + Auto-Launch*

## ⚡ Quick Start

```python
from modules.communication.auto_meeting_orchestrator import MeetingOrchestrator
from modules.communication.auto_meeting_orchestrator.src.orchestrator import Priority, PresenceStatus

# Initialize orchestrator
amo = MeetingOrchestrator()

# Create meeting intent
intent_id = await amo.create_meeting_intent(
    requester_id="alice",
    recipient_id="bob",
    purpose="Brainstorm partnership idea", 
    expected_outcome="Agreement on next steps",
    duration_minutes=30,
    priority=Priority.HIGH
)

# Update presence (triggers automatic orchestration)
await amo.update_presence("alice", "discord", PresenceStatus.ONLINE)
await amo.update_presence("bob", "discord", PresenceStatus.ONLINE)

# Meeting automatically orchestrated when both available!
```

## 🔄 Core Handshake Protocol

### **Minimal Viable Flow - 7-Step Process**

#### **1️⃣ User Availability Status**
When users log in, they select **availability scope**:
- **Public** - Anyone can request meetings
- **Contacts only** - LinkedIn, Facebook, Twitter connections only  
- **Private** - No meeting requests accepted

```python
availability_scope = "public" | "contacts" | "private"
```

This governs **who can see them as available** and request meetings.

#### **2️⃣ Intent Declaration (3-Question Form)**
Someone wanting to meet completes structured context:

1. **Why do you want to meet?** *(Purpose)*
2. **What do you hope to get out of it?** *(Expected Outcome)*  
3. **How long do you expect it to take?** *(Duration)*

Plus **Importance Rating (1-10)** from requester's perspective.

**Example Intent:**
```json
{
  "why": "Brainstorm partnership project",
  "outcome": "Agree on next steps and timeline", 
  "duration": "30 minutes",
  "importance_rating": 8
}
```

#### **3️⃣ Eligibility & Visibility Check**
System automatically validates:
- ✅ Is recipient **public** or within **requester's network**?
- ✅ If yes: Show in available list
- ✅ If no: Block request silently

#### **4️⃣ Recipient Notification & Response**
Recipient receives **context-rich prompt**:
- Who wants to meet
- The 3 structured answers
- Requester's importance rating (1-10)

**Recipient actions:**
- Accept or decline meeting
- Rate **how important it is to meet (1-10)** from their perspective

#### **5️⃣ Rating Integrity & Anti-Gaming**
**Critical Innovation:** System tracks **rating distribution patterns**:

```python
credibility_score = (variance_of_ratings) × (historical_engagement_success_rate)
```

**Anti-Gaming Measures:**
- Users who always rate "10" get **reduced weight** in priority sorting
- Users consistently rated low by others get **reduced visibility**
- **Reputation scoring** prevents spam and gaming

#### **6️⃣ Handshake Completion**
If recipient **accepts**:
- ✅ System records both party ratings
- ✅ Stores complete intent metadata
- ✅ Marks handshake **active**
- ✅ Triggers **intelligent channel selection** (Discord, Zoom, WhatsApp, etc.)

#### **7️⃣ Autonomous Session Launch**
- ✅ Auto-creates meeting on optimal platform
- ✅ Sends invitations with preserved context
- ✅ Logs complete meeting lifecycle
- ✅ Schedules or launches immediately based on mutual availability

## 🌐 **Minimal Web App Architecture**

### **Frontend Requirements**
```typescript
// Core Components
- Login (OAuth: LinkedIn/Google)
- Availability Toggle (Public/Contacts/Private)  
- Request Form (3 questions + importance slider)
- Incoming Request View (with context display)
- Accept/Decline Interface (with rating)
- Meeting Dashboard (active sessions)
```

### **Backend Architecture** 
```python
# Minimal Stack
- Node/Express or Python/FastAPI
- PostgreSQL or SQLite database
- OAuth authentication
- Reputation scoring engine
- Platform integration APIs

# Core Database Schema
Users: {id, name, email, availability_scope, credibility_score}
Requests: {id, requester_id, recipient_id, intent_data, status}
Ratings: {id, request_id, requester_rating, recipient_rating}
Sessions: {id, request_id, platform, meeting_link, status}
```

### **API Routes**
```javascript
POST /api/requests          // Create meeting intent
GET  /api/requests/pending  // Get incoming requests  
PUT  /api/requests/:id      // Accept/decline with rating
POST /api/availability      // Update availability scope
GET  /api/sessions/active   // Current meeting sessions
```

## 🔄 Workflow

### 1️⃣ Intent Declaration
User A initiates a meeting request for User B with structured context:
- **Purpose:** Why meet? *(e.g., "Brainstorm partnership idea")*
- **Expected Outcome:** What's the goal? *(e.g., "Agreement on next steps")* 
- **Duration:** How long? *(e.g., 30 minutes)*
- **Priority:** How urgent? *(000-222 scale)*

### 2️⃣ Presence Aggregation  
System monitors real-time availability across platforms:
- WhatsApp online/offline
- Discord idle/active
- LinkedIn presence
- Google Calendar free/busy
- Zoom status

Creates **Unified Availability Profile (UAP)** with confidence scoring.

### 3️⃣ Priority Scoring
Recipients rate urgency, combined with sender priority to calculate **Priority Index**.

### 4️⃣ Service Selection
Auto-selects optimal platform based on:
- Both users' active platforms
- Historical preferences  
- Current device context
- Platform capabilities

### 5️⃣ Consent & Reminder
Recipient gets instant prompt with full context:
> "Alice is available to meet now about:  
> • Brainstorm partnership idea  
> • Expected: 30 min  
> • Priority: 8/10  
> Accept?"

### 6️⃣ Handshake + Session Launch
- Calendar placeholder created
- Meeting launched automatically  
- Both parties notified
- Context preserved in session

```bash
cd modules/communication/auto_meeting_orchestrator/src/
python orchestrator.py
```

### Run Test Suite
```bash
cd modules/communication/auto_meeting_orchestrator/
python -m pytest tests/ -v
```

### Expected PoC Output
```
=== AMO PoC Demo ===
✅ Meeting intent created: intent_1
📡 Simulating presence updates...
🤝 Meeting prompt triggered:
   Alice is available to meet about:
   • Purpose: Brainstorm partnership idea
   • Expected outcome: Agreement on next steps  
   • Duration: 30 minutes
   • Priority: HIGH
📊 Final Status:
   Active intents: 0
   Completed meetings: 1
```

## 🌟 Key Benefits
