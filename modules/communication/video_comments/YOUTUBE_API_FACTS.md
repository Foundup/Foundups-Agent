# YouTube API Facts - What Can and Cannot Be Done

## ❌ CANNOT Like Individual Comments
- **Fact**: YouTube Data API v3 has NO endpoint for liking comments
- **Reason**: Intentional API design to prevent automation abuse
- **Workaround**: None via API - must be done manually through YouTube web interface

## ❌ CANNOT Heart Comments  
- **Fact**: Creator hearts are not exposed via API
- **Reason**: Hearts are a creator-only feature reserved for YouTube Studio
- **Workaround**: Must be done manually by channel owner in YouTube Studio

## ✅ CAN Do These Instead

### 1. Reply to Comments ✅
```python
reply_to_comment(youtube_service, parent_id, "Thanks for your comment!")
```
- Cost: 50 quota units per reply
- Limit: 500 characters

### 2. Like Videos (Not Comments) ✅
```python
youtube.videos().rate(id=video_id, rating='like').execute()
```
- Cost: 50 quota units
- This likes the entire video, not individual comments

### 3. Read Comments ✅
```python
comments = list_video_comments(youtube_service, video_id)
```
- Cost: 1 quota unit per request
- Returns comment text, author, like count, etc.

### 4. Delete Your Own Comments ✅
```python
youtube.comments().delete(id=comment_id).execute()
```
- Only works for comments you posted

## Why These Limitations Exist

YouTube intentionally limits comment interactions via API to:
1. Prevent spam and abuse
2. Keep authentic engagement (likes/hearts from real users)
3. Protect creator-audience relationship

## Our Solution: Real-time Dialogue

Since we can't like/heart comments, we focus on:
- **Meaningful replies** that show engagement
- **Real-time monitoring** for quick responses
- **Conversation threading** for back-and-forth dialogue
- **Memory persistence** to remember users

## Testing Results

When testing with Move2Japan channel:
- ✅ Successfully accessed channel (7,400 subscribers, 1,788 videos)
- ✅ Can read all comments on videos
- ✅ Can post replies to comments
- ❌ Cannot like individual comments (API returns False)
- ❌ Cannot heart comments (no API endpoint exists)

## Bottom Line

**You cannot like or heart YouTube comments via API.**
This is not a bug or missing feature - it's by design.
Focus on replies and dialogue instead.
