# Test Documentation - Channel Selector

## Test Strategy
This test suite is designed to validate the functionality of the Channel Selector module, ensuring it operates autonomously within the WRE ecosystem for 0102 pArtifacts. The strategy focuses on comprehensive coverage of channel selection logic and communication routing capabilities.

## How to Run Tests
1. Ensure the WRE environment is set up with necessary dependencies.
2. Navigate to the project root directory.
3. Run `pytest modules/communication/channel_selector/tests/` to execute the test suite.

## Test Data and Fixtures
- **Fixtures**: Placeholder fixtures will be implemented for mock channel data and selection scenarios.
- **Mock Data**: Simulated communication inputs and channel contexts for routing validation.

## Expected Behavior
- The Channel Selector should autonomously determine the appropriate communication channels based on predefined criteria during simulated scenarios.
- All tests should pass with assertions confirming correct selection behavior and output.

## Integration Requirements
- **Dependencies**: Requires integration with Communication domain modules and WRE orchestration for full functionality.
- **Cross-Module Tests**: Future tests will validate interactions with other communication modules and platform integrations.
