# ARCHIVED: test_runner.py

**Archive Date:** 2025-05-29  
**Reason:** Enhanced with WSP compliance integration  
**Replacement:** `tools/shared/test_runner_enhanced.py`

## Why This Tool Was Archived

This basic test runner was identified in the **Tools Directory Audit Report** as containing:
- **Limited scope** (single module testing only)
- **No WSP compliance checking** despite testing being core to WSP 14
- **No ModLog integration** for test result documentation
- **Basic functionality** without automation enhancements

## What Replaced It

The test runner functionality has been enhanced and integrated into the **WSP Compliance Engine** architecture:

### ✅ Enhanced Capabilities
- **WSP 14 compliance checking** for test strategy evaluation
- **ModLog integration** for automatic test result documentation  
- **MPS scoring integration** for module priority assessment
- **Pre-execution validation** using WSP Compliance Engine
- **Comprehensive reporting** with recommendations and metrics

### 🔧 Migration Path
```bash
# Old usage (basic test runner)
python tools/test_runner.py

# New usage (WSP-enhanced test runner)
python tools/shared/test_runner_enhanced.py modules/ai_intelligence/banter_engine/
python -c "from tools.shared.test_runner_enhanced import WSPTestRunner; runner = WSPTestRunner(); results = runner.run_module_tests('modules/ai_intelligence/banter_engine/')"
```

### 📊 Feature Comparison
| Feature | Legacy | Enhanced |
|---------|--------|----------|
| Basic test execution | ✅ | ✅ |
| WSP 14 compliance | ❌ | ✅ |
| ModLog integration | ❌ | ✅ |
| MPS scoring | ❌ | ✅ |
| Test strategy evaluation | ❌ | ✅ |
| Comprehensive reporting | ❌ | ✅ |
| Agent 0102 integration | ❌ | ✅ |

## Historical Context

This tool provided:
- Simple test runner for `TestComprehensiveChatCommunication`
- Basic test suite execution with verbose output
- Simple success rate calculation
- Basic failure and error reporting

**All functionality preserved and significantly enhanced in the shared architecture.**

## Integration with WSP Compliance Engine

The enhanced test runner is now part of the **WSP Compliance Engine** workflow:

1. **Pre-execution validation** - Tests evaluated against WSP 14 requirements
2. **Test strategy assessment** - Automated recommendations for test improvements  
3. **ModLog documentation** - Automatic logging of test results and compliance scores
4. **Agent 0102 integration** - Test results inform agent decision-making processes
