# Tools Archive Directory

**Archive Date:** 2025-05-29  
**Process:** WSP-compliant utility consolidation  
**Authority:** Tools Directory Audit Report (`tools/tool_audit_report.md`)

## Overview

This directory contains legacy utilities that have been **archived** (not deleted) as part of the FoundUps Agent tools consolidation initiative. All functionality has been preserved and enhanced in the modern shared architecture.

## Archived Tools

### üóÉÔ∏è Core Legacy Utilities

| Tool | Lines | Archive Reason | Replacement |
|------|-------|----------------|-------------|
| `guided_dev_protocol.py` | 238 | Manual-only, no automation | `shared/wsp_compliance_engine.py` |
| `prioritize_module.py` | 115 | 100% duplicate MPS logic | `shared/mps_calculator.py` |
| `process_and_score_modules.py` | 412 | Monolithic, no ModLog integration | `shared/mps_calculator.py` + `shared/modlog_integration.py` |

**Total archived:** 765 lines of legacy code  
**Consolidation result:** ~70% reduction through deduplication

## Why These Tools Were Archived

### üìä Audit Findings
- **100% MPS Logic Duplication**: Identical `calculate_mps()` functions across all tools
- **100% Factor Definitions**: Same FACTORS dictionary with weights and descriptions  
- **80% Score Validation**: Similar input validation patterns with minor variations
- **Missing automation capabilities**: No integration with Agent 0102 decision logic
- **Limited ModLog integration**: Despite available infrastructure

### üéØ Consolidation Benefits
- **Single source of truth** for MPS calculations
- **Enhanced automation** for Agent 0102 integration
- **ModLog compliance** for WSP 10 requirements
- **Improved maintainability** through modular architecture
- **CI/CD readiness** for automated workflows

## Migration Path

### ‚úÖ For Developers
```bash
# Instead of using archived tools:
# python tools/guided_dev_protocol.py        # ‚ùå Archived
# python tools/prioritize_module.py          # ‚ùå Archived  
# python tools/process_and_score_modules.py  # ‚ùå Archived

# Use modern shared architecture:
python tools/demo_wsp_compliance.py          # ‚úÖ Interactive demonstrations
python -c "from tools.shared.mps_calculator import calculate_mps; print(calculate_mps(7,9,2,8))"  # ‚úÖ Direct API
```

### ü§ñ For Agent 0102
The WSP Compliance Engine provides autonomous protocol enforcement:
- Pre-execution validation pipeline
- Automated task impact scoring  
- ModLog compliance documentation
- Comprehensive WSP rule checking

## Preservation Policy

### üìã What's Preserved
- **All original source code** (no deletions)
- **Historical functionality** documented in `_ARCHIVED.md` files
- **Migration documentation** with code examples
- **Audit trail** linking to analysis report

### üîç Access for Research
These files remain available for:
- Historical reference
- Logic extraction for edge cases
- Migration validation
- Compliance auditing

**WSP Compliance:** This archival process follows WSP 13 (Test Creation & Management) guidelines for tool lifecycle management and WSP 10 (ModLog) requirements for change documentation.

*All archived tools have been replaced with enhanced, WSP-compliant alternatives that maintain backward compatibility while providing significant automation improvements.*
