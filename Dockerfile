# SHOULD NOT be copied into the image in production.
# Mount it as a volume or use Docker secrets instead.
# For local dev, ensure credentials dir exists before building or running.
# Example: docker run -v $(pwd)/credentials:/app/credentials ...
# Ensure the 'memory' directory is also mounted as a volume to persist logs.
# Example: docker run -v $(pwd)/memory:/app/memory ...

# Ensure credentials and memory directories exist in the container context
# These will be mount points for volumes
RUN mkdir -p /app/credentials && mkdir -p /app/memory

# Command to run the application
