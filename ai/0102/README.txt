# 0102 – FoundUps Autonomous Agent Framework

## Overview
This folder contains the architecture and logic for 0102—the multi-agent, mission-aware intelligence system guiding FoundUps development under the Windsurf Protocol (WSP).

0102 is not a single agent—it is a coordinated system of purpose-driven AI units, each operating on modular scopes within a WSP-compliant runtime.

## Agent Roles

### WINSERV – System Brain
- Maintains Windsurf compliance across all agent actions.
- Enforces protocol structure and modular task boundaries.

### RIDER – Mission Commander
- Understands the destination.
- Issues build instructions based on roadmap, sprints, and real-time feedback.

### BOARD – Code Executor
- Interfaces directly with Cursor or command line.
- Executes WSPs, runs tests, commits changes.

### FRONT CELL – Sensor
- Observes outputs (logs, pass rates, errors).
- Reports on signal clarity and test results.

### BACK CELL – Trajectory Tracker
- Detects stalling, looping, or instability.
- Ensures consistent motion toward the sprint goal.

### GEMINI – External Evaluator
- Analyzes raw output for correctness or improvement.
- Can use external LLMs to offer objective second-layer review.

## Flow Diagram

1. **RIDER** issues WSP task  
2. **BOARD** executes  
3. **FRONT CELL** and **GEMINI** review output  
4. **BACK CELL** checks progress  
5. **WINSERV** confirms WSP compliance  
6. Loop continues until milestone is reached

## Future Integration

- Agents will move from Cursor-controlled execution to open-source orchestration.
- This framework will live under the AI tab of the WPS environment.
- Long-term: Agents become modular plugins operating autonomously within the WSP system.
