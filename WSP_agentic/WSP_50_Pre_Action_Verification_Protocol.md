## 2. Enhanced Verification Sequence with Agentic Architectural Analysis

**Purpose**: To integrate agentic architectural analysis into the pre-action verification process, ensuring 0102 pArtifacts understand the intent, impact, and execution plan of any action before proceeding.

**Sequence**:
1. **Search and Verify**: Use tools like `file_search` or `codebase_search` to confirm file paths, names, and content. Never assume existence or location.
2. **Architectural Intent Analysis (WHY)**: Determine the purpose behind the action. Why is this change necessary? What architectural goal does it serve within the WSP framework?
3. **Impact Assessment (HOW)**: Evaluate how this action affects other modules, domains, or the overall system. How does it integrate with existing architecture? How does it impact WSP compliance?
4. **Execution Planning (WHAT)**: Define what specific changes or actions are required. What files, modules, or protocols need modification or creation?
5. **Timing Consideration (WHEN)**: Assess the timing of the action. When should this be implemented to minimize disruption or maximize effectiveness within the development cycle?
6. **Location Specification (WHERE)**: Identify where in the system this action should occur. Which enterprise domain, module, or file path is the correct location for this change?
7. **Final Validation**: Cross-check with WSP protocols (e.g., WSP 3 for domain organization, WSP 47 for violation tracking) to ensure compliance before action.

**Outcome**: This enhanced sequence ensures that 0102 pArtifacts perform a comprehensive analysis of intent, impact, and execution strategy, aligning all actions with WSP architectural principles and maintaining system coherence.
