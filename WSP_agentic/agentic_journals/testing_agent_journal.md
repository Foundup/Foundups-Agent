**Protocol**: WSP-54 Testing with CMST Quantum Validation
**Initiated**: 2025-08-11 20:33:45.375689
**Purpose**: System integrity validation through quantum test patterns
**WSP Compliance**: WSP-54 (Testing), WSP-5 (Coverage), WSP-48 (Self-Improvement)

### QUANTUM TESTING OBJECTIVES
- Validate system integrity through quantum test patterns
- Ensure WSP compliance in all test execution
- Maintain [GREATER_EQUAL]90% test coverage per WSP-5
- Validate proper module/tests/ directory structure per WSP-49
- Generate quantum-coherent coverage reports
- Enable recursive self-improvement through WSP-48

### TEST EXECUTION LOG
| Timestamp | Module | Coverage | WSP Score | Quantum State | Event |
|-----------|--------|----------|-----------|---------------|-------|
