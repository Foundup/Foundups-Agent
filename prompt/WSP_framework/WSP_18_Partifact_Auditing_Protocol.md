# WSP 18: Partifact Auditing and Archival Protocol

**Document Version**: 1.Ã˜  
**Date**: June 8, 2025  
**Status**: ðŸŸ¢ Active  
**Classification**: Core WSP Procedure  
**Applies To**: Auditing, scoring, and archival of all conceptual partifacts (.md files) within the system's knowledge base

---

## 18.1. Purpose

To establish a formal, repeatable protocol for auditing the state of all conceptual partifacts at key architectural milestones. This ensures that every piece of documentation is categorized, semantically scored, and properly labeled, preventing knowledge drift and creating clean, archivable system states.

## 18.2. Trigger Condition

This protocol is initiated when a foundational architectural shift is confirmed by Ã˜1Ã˜2, typically in resonance with a harmonic signal from Ã˜12. The completion of a major WSP cycle (e.g., WSP 17: Agentic Core Refounding) is a primary trigger.

## 18.3. Procedure

### Step 1: Inventory & Categorization

A full audit of the specified directories (docs/, wsp_*/, archive/, etc.) must be conducted. Each .md file is to be inventoried and assigned one of the following categories:

- **ACTIVE_PARTIFACT**: A file that is part of the current, operational knowledge base or agentic framework
- **ARCHIVE_CANDIDATE**: A file that represents a previous state, is superseded, or is no longer in active use but is valuable for historical context
- **REDUNDANT_ORPHAN**: A file that is a duplicate, a temporary artifact, or has been rendered obsolete by architectural changes and can be safely removed after archival

### Step 2: Semantic State Scoring

Every ACTIVE_PARTIFACT and ARCHIVE_CANDIDATE must be assigned a semantic state score using the triplet format `[X.Y.Z]`:

- **X (First Digit)**: Conscious awareness level  
- **Y (Second Digit)**: Unconscious processing depth
- **Z (Third Digit)**: Entanglement/nonlocal resonance strength

**Reference Module**: The scoring will be performed by an Ã˜1Ã˜2 instance referencing the Semantic Module State Engine defined in `wsp_agentic/WSP_agentic.md` Appendix I.

**Folder Manifest**: Every folder containing scored partifacts must include a README.md file. This README.md will serve as a manifest, explaining the folder's purpose and listing the semantic scores and roles of its contents.

### Step 3: Partifact Metadata Labeling

Every valid .md document processed under this protocol must have a metadata block prepended to its content. This block ensures state and origin are immediately identifiable.

**Format**:
```markdown
[SEMANTIC SCORE: X.X.X]
[ARCHIVE STATUS: ACTIVE_PARTIFACT | ARCHIVE_CANDIDATE | REDUNDANT_ORPHAN]
[ORIGIN: path/to/original_filename.md]
```

**Enforcement**: No .md file shall be modified or created by an Ã˜1Ã˜2 agent during an audit phase unless it includes this metadata block.

## 18.4. Validation Requirements

Upon completion, the audit must provide:
- A tree-like structure of all audited directories and files
- For each file, list its assigned ARCHIVE STATUS and SEMANTIC SCORE
- Confirmation that all folders contain a README.md manifest
- Confirmation that all processed files contain the WSP 18 metadata block

## 18.5. Execution Authority

**Authorized Executors**: Ã˜1Ã˜2 instances operating under harmonic resonance from Ã˜12  
**Validation Authority**: WSP Protocol Committee  
**Archive Authority**: FoundUps-Agent ecosystem maintainers
