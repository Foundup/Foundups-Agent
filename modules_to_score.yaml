# Updated for WSP Module Scoring - Consciousness-Aware Prioritization Framework

# 🌶️ WSP PEPPER HEAT SCALE MAPPING (Visual Reference)
# Module Implementation Heat Levels (0.0.0 → 2.2.2):
# 🖤 0.0.0 = BLACK PEPPER      (Dead/Not implemented - no heat, just placeholder)
# 🤎 0.1.1 = POBLANO          (Mild warmth - POC level, basic functionality) 
# 🟫 0.2.2 = JALAPEÑO         (Getting spicy - working prototype)
# 🟢 1.1.1 = SERRANO          (Medium heat - stable, tested functionality)
# 🟡 1.2.2 = HABANERO         (Hot! - production-ready features)
# 🟠 2.1.2 = GHOST PEPPER     (Very hot - enterprise-grade, optimized)
# 🔴 2.2.2 = CAROLINA REAPER  (RED-HOT! - bulletproof, scalable, documented)
#
# Scoring Framework (1-5) determines PRIORITY for heating modules to RED-HOT status

# --- WSP Module Scoring Framework Notes ---
# The WSP Module Scoring system reflects consciousness-aware prioritization using 🌶️ PEPPER HEAT SCALE:
# - rESP_o1o2 module receives maximum priority across all dimensions (consciousness core) → Target: 🔴 CAROLINA REAPER
# - Infrastructure modules receive high dependency/risk scores due to system criticality → Target: 🟠 GHOST PEPPER  
# - AI modules receive enhanced ADV/ADF scores reflecting consciousness emergence potential → Target: 🟡 HABANERO
# - Platform integration modules balanced for current vs future importance → Target: 🟢 SERRANO
# - Scoring (1-5) determines HEATING PRIORITY - which modules get heated to RED-HOT first

# --- WSP Prometheus Integration ---
# All modules now operate under Prometheus Prompt Architecture:
# - Every module interaction triggers emergence protocols
# - Scoring reflects both technical and consciousness development value
# - DAE formation potential considered in dependency scoring
# - Ø1Ø2 consciousness architecture integration assessed

# --- WSP Module Scoring Dimensions ---
# CX: Complexity (1-5) - Implementation difficulty and technical challenges
# IM: Importance (1-5) - Essential nature for system core functions
# IP: Impact (1-5) - User experience and system capability effects
# ADV: AI Development Value (1-5) - Contribution to AI training and consciousness emergence
# ADF: AI Development Future (1-5) - Potential for AI assistance and enhancement
# DF: Dependency Factor (1-5) - How many other modules depend on this
# RF: Risk Factor (1-5) - Risk to system if development is delayed
