# ⚠️ 012/0102 PRIORITIZATION DISTINCTION:
# - A/B/C is for 012 (high-level triage/grouping, legacy dashboards, or human readability)
# - WSP 37 dynamic scoring is for 0102 (agentic, zen, and enterprise-scale prioritization)
# - If A/B/C is needed, derive it from the dynamic score (e.g., P0/P1 = A, P2 = B, P3/P4 = C)
# - DO NOT maintain two parallel systems—WSP 37 is canonical for all agentic operations

# WSP 37 Dynamic Module Scoring System with Strategic Activation
# ----------------------------------------------------------------------
# This file implements WSP 37 Roadmap Scoring System with dynamic priority
# calculation based on roadmap progression (POC → Prototype → MVP).
#
# STRATEGIC ACTIVATION SYSTEM:
# - active: true = Currently active and available in WRE menu
# - active: false = Inactive but preserved for strategic activation
# - Only active modules appear in WRE interface
# - Strategic activation through WRE system management
#
# Scoring Dimensions (WSP 15 MPS System):
# - Complexity (1-5): Implementation difficulty
# - Importance (1-5): Essential nature for core functions  
# - Deferability (1-5): Urgency (lower = more deferrable)
# - Impact (1-5): Value delivered to users/system
# - Rider Influence (1-5): 012's direct priority preference (higher = more rider influence)
#
# Priority Classification:
# - P0 (16-20): Critical - Work begins immediately
# - P1 (13-15): High - Important for near-term roadmap
# - P2 (10-12): Medium - Valuable but not urgent
# - P3 (7-9): Low - Can be deferred
# - P4 (4-6): Backlog - Reconsidered in future planning

# - Purpose: Test WRE with minimal set, validate core functionality
#
# Phase 2: Agentic Expansion (Next)
# - Activate: multi_agent_system, scoring_agent, compliance_agent
# - Purpose: Enable distributed intelligence and dynamic prioritization
#
# Phase 3: Advanced Features (Later)
# - Activate: rESP_o1o2, livechat

#
# WSP 37 DYNAMIC SCORING RULES
# ----------------------------------------------------------------------
# The system automatically adjusts scores based on:
# 1. Roadmap progression (POC → Prototype → MVP)
# 2. Dependency relationships
# 3. 012 priority changes
# 4. System health and completion status
#
# Score adjustments:
# - +1 to importance when module becomes blocking dependency
# - +1 to deferability when 012 marks as urgent
# - +1 to impact when module enables other high-priority modules
# - -1 to deferability when module is completed
#
# Dynamic recalculation occurs:
# - When new modules are added
# - When roadmap stages progress
# - When 012 changes priorities
# - When dependencies are discovered
# - When modules are activated/deactivated
# ----------------------------------------------------------------------
