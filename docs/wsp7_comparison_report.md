# Prometheus Diff Report - WSP 7 Baseline Comparison

## Baseline: legacy/clean3
## Target: Current working directory

### Structure Changes Analysis:

1. **Module Organization Changes**:
   - ✅ Refactored modules now properly follow Windsurf structure (src/tests directories)
   - ✅ Added INTERFACE.md and requirements.txt to all modules (part of WSP 11 & 12 compliance)

2. **File Movements**:
   - MOVED: Flat files from clean3 are now organized into appropriate src/ directories
   - MOVED: Test files are now properly located in tests/ directories

3. **New Files**:
   - ADDED: INTERFACE.md (in all modules - WSP 11 compliance)
   - ADDED: requirements.txt (in all modules - WSP 12 compliance)
   - ADDED: test_emoji_sequence_map.py (banter/tests)
   - ADDED: test_live_chat_poller.py (live_chat_poller/tests)
   - ADDED: test_live_chat_processor.py (live_chat_processor/tests)
   - ADDED: test_quota_manager.py (livechat/tests)
   - ADDED: test_stream_resolver.py (stream_resolver/tests)
   - ADDED: test_token_manager.py (token_manager/tests)
   - ADDED: test_youtube_auth.py (youtube_auth/tests)
   - ADDED: sequence_responses.py (banter module)

### Manual Check Results (Substitute for FMAS Mode 2):

1. **Interface Definitions (INTERFACE.md)**:
   - ✅ Present in all modules as required by WSP 11
   - ✅ These files are correctly EXTRA compared to clean3

2. **Dependency Manifests (requirements.txt)**:
   - ✅ Present in all modules as required by WSP 12
   - ✅ These files are correctly EXTRA compared to clean3

3. **Flat File Structure in clean3**:
   - ✅ Original flat files (e.g., modules/token_manager.py) are now correctly categorized as MISSING
   - ✅ These are now in src/ directories in the modular structure

4. **Test Coverage Analysis (WSP 5)**:
   - ✅ Added test files for previously untested modules:
     - live_chat_poller, live_chat_processor, stream_resolver, token_manager, youtube_auth
   - ❌ **stream_resolver module**: 79% coverage (Below 90% required threshold)
     - Missing coverage in error handling paths and quota management code
   - ❌ **livechat module**: 35% coverage (Significantly below 90% required threshold)
     - Major gaps in chat message processing, polling, and event handling

### Test Warnings & Issues:

1. **Livechat Module**:
   - 12 warnings detected, including:
     - RuntimeWarning: coroutines never awaited
     - DeprecationWarning: test methods returning non-None values
   - These issues should be addressed as part of the test improvement process

2. **Stream Resolver Module**:
   - 1 test failure in `test_get_active_livestream_with_unhandled_exception`
   - This should be fixed before proceeding

### VALIDATION STATUS: ❌ FAILED
- Structure changes align with expected Windsurf refactoring ✅
- Interface and dependency artifacts are properly added ✅
- Original flat structure is correctly migrated to modular structure ✅
- Test file existence has improved significantly ✅
- Test coverage is insufficient to meet WSP 5 requirements ❌
- Several test warnings and failures need to be addressed ❌

### Recommended Actions:
1. Fix test failure in stream_resolver
2. Address async warnings in livechat tests
3. Increase test coverage for both modules to meet 90% threshold:
   - stream_resolver: 79% → 90%+ (need ~11% increase)
   - livechat: 35% → 90%+ (need ~55% increase)
