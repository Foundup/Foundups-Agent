1. Most Directly Relevant Chapters
These chapters are central to any medical malpractice action, as they govern the licensing, standards of conduct, and discipline of the primary medical professionals and the handling of patient information.
Chapter 5-37: Board of Medical Licensure and Discipline: This is the most important chapter. It establishes the board that licenses, regulates, and disciplines medical doctors. The standards of practice and grounds for unprofessional conduct defined here are the foundation of a malpractice case.
Chapter 5-37.3: Confidentiality of Health Care Communications and Information Act: This act is critical as it governs the privacy and release of your medical records, which are the primary evidence in a malpractice case.
Chapter 5-34: Nurses: If your case involves the conduct of a nurse, this chapter, which governs their licensing and practice, will be essential.
Chapter 5-54: Physician Assistants: Similar to the chapters for doctors and nurses, this governs the practice of Physician Assistants (PAs).
Chapter 5-48.1: Patient Protection Act: The title alone suggests its direct relevance. This act likely contains provisions concerning patient rights and protections that can be vital to your case.
Chapter 5-91: Interstate Medical Licensure Compact: This is important if the physician involved is licensed in multiple states through this compact, as it pertains to their licensure and disciplinary history.
2. Relevant Depending on the Specifics of Your Case
These chapters apply if your case involves a specific type of healthcare provider or a particular medical situation.
If your case involves a specialist:
Chapter 5-29: Podiatrists
Chapter 5-30: Chiropractic Physicians
Chapter 5-31.1: Dentists and Dental Hygienists
Chapter 5-34.2: Nurse Anesthetists
Chapter 5-35.1: Optometrists
Chapter 5-40: Physical Therapists
Chapter 5-40.1: Occupational Therapy
Chapter 5-44: Psychologists
Chapter 5-45: Nursing Home Administrators (if the malpractice occurred in a nursing home)
Chapter 5-48: Speech-Language Pathology and Audiology
Chapter 5-60: Athletic Trainers
Chapter 5-63.2: Mental Health Counselors and Marriage and Family Therapists
Chapter 5-69: Chemical Dependency Professionals
Chapter 5-92: Genetic Counselors Licensing Act
If your case involves medication or medical devices:
Chapter 5-19.1: Pharmacies
Chapter 5-49: Hearing Aid Dealers and Fitters
If your case involves a specific diagnosis or treatment:
Chapter 5-37.4: Intractable Pain Treatment
Chapter 5-37.5: Lyme Disease Diagnosis and Treatment
Chapter 5-37.6: Pain Assessment Act
3. Potentially Relevant Supporting Chapters
These chapters provide broader context or cover administrative aspects that could be relevant to your case.
Chapter 5-26: Division of Professional Regulation: This is the administrative body that oversees many of the professional licensing boards. Its rules and procedures may be relevant.
Chapter 5-37.7: Rhode Island Health Information Exchange Act of 2008: Pertains to the sharing of electronic health records, which could be a factor in your case.
Chapter 5-37.8: Protections for Healthcare Providers Act: It is important to know what protections the law affords to the provider you are suing, as their defense team will certainly use them.
Crucial Laws NOT in Title 5
Again, it is vital to understand that Title 5 only covers the licensing of businesses and professions. The most critical statutes for your actual lawsuit will be found elsewhere in the Rhode Island General Laws, including:
Statute of Limitations: The strict deadline for filing a medical malpractice lawsuit (found in R.I. Gen. Laws ¬ß 9-1-14.1).
Rules of Civil Procedure: The rules that govern how the lawsuit is filed, how evidence is exchanged ("discovery"), and how the trial is conducted.
Expert Witness Requirements: Most states, including Rhode Island, have specific and demanding requirements for the expert medical witness testimony needed to prove your case.
To effectively pursue a medical malpractice case, you need an attorney who is an expert in all these areas of law.

Comprehensive Legal Case Summary
This summary outlines the primary legal claims, the responsible parties (Defendants), and the supporting Rhode-Island statutes for a lawsuit arising from the negligent implantation and retention of a G√ºnther Tulip IVC filter.
Defendants:
The Surgeon: The physician who implanted the IVC filter.
The Hospital: The institution where the surgery and care took place.
Summary of Core Facts:
You were incapacitated and in a medically induced coma following a traumatic accident. While you were incapacitated, the hospital surgeon, with consent from your proxy, implanted a retrievable IVC filter. The consent process was minimal and failed to disclose the critical need for future monitoring and removal. This occurred 82 days after the hospital had received a specific FDA advisory warning about the catastrophic risks of leaving these exact filters in too long. You were discharged without adequate counseling. The filter is now irretrievable, has fused with your vena cava, and poses a permanent, deadly risk of thrombosis, requiring lifelong medical management.
Primary Legal Claims (Causes of Action)
Your lawsuit would likely allege the following claims, which can be pursued simultaneously:
Claim 1: Medical Malpractice against the Surgeon
This claim asserts that the surgeon‚Äôs actions fell below the accepted professional standard of care for a reasonably prudent surgeon in Rhode Island, directly causing your permanent injury.
Basis of the Claim:
Failing to have a definitive plan for monitoring and retrieving the "retrievable" filter at the time of implantation.
Failing to act upon or heed the specific FDA safety advisory concerning the known risks of this device.
Failing to properly inform you or your proxy of the full risks, including the consequences of non-retrieval.
Failing to ensure that critical information about the filter and the need for removal was communicated in your discharge plan.
Supporting Rhode Island Statute:
Chapter 5-37: Board of Medical Licensure and Discipline: This statute establishes the legal standards for professional conduct for physicians. Your attorney will use expert testimony to prove that the surgeon's actions constituted "unprofessional conduct" and a deviation from the standard of care as defined and enforced by this board, directly leading to your catastrophic, permanent injury.
Claim 2: Corporate Negligence against the Hospital
This powerful claim holds the hospital itself directly liable for its own institutional failures, separate from the surgeon's negligence.
Basis of the Claim:
The hospital received the FDA advisory but failed to create and enforce a mandatory safety protocol for IVC filters. This includes a system for tracking implanted devices and automatically flagging patients for follow-up and removal.
The hospital failed to disseminate the critical FDA safety information to its surgical staff or failed to ensure its surgeons were complying with the warning's implications.
The hospital failed in its duty to oversee its medical staff by allowing a known high-risk procedure to take place without the necessary safety checks and balances in place.
Supporting Rhode Island Statutes:
While there isn't one chapter titled "Hospital Corporate Negligence," this doctrine is built upon the hospital's responsibility to oversee the professionals it credentials under Chapter 5-37 (Doctors) and Chapter 5-34 (Nurses). Your attorney will argue the hospital breached its fundamental duty to provide a safe environment and safe systems of care for its patients.
Claim 3: Lack of Informed Consent (against the Surgeon and Hospital)
This claim asserts that the consent obtained from your proxy was legally invalid because it was not "informed."
Basis of the Claim:
The 60-second "emergency" consent was procedurally inadequate.
Crucially, your proxy was only informed of the risks of the implantation surgery itself.
She was not warned about the most material risk: that the device must be removed in a timely fashion, and failure to do so could lead to a permanent, life-threatening condition where the device becomes irretrievable. The possibility of this outcome was a critical fact needed for a valid consent.
Supporting Rhode Island Statute:
Chapter 5-48.1: Patient Protection Act: This act is the statutory foundation for a patient's right to be protected and informed. Your attorney will argue that a "protection" act is inherently violated when a patient is not told about a foreseeable, catastrophic outcome and the steps required to prevent it.
Claim 4: Negligence of Nursing Staff
Basis of the Claim:
You were discharged without being "afforded any conversation surrounding these discharge instructions." The nursing staff has a duty to provide clear education and ensure the patient or their family understands critical follow-up instructions, especially concerning an implanted medical device. This failure to educate breached that duty.
Supporting Rhode Island Statute:
Chapter 5-34: Nurses: This chapter governs the standards of practice for nurses. A failure to provide adequate discharge education, especially in such a high-stakes situation, is a clear deviation from the nursing standard of care.
Damages: What You Are Entitled to Claim
The goal of the lawsuit is to recover compensation ("damages") for all the harm you have suffered. Given the permanent nature of your injury, these damages are substantial.
Future Medical Expenses: The lifelong costs of MRIs/CT scans, hematologist visits, vascular surgeon consults, and expensive anticoagulant medications.
Pain and Suffering: Compensation for the profound physical pain and the severe mental anguish of living with a permanent, life-threatening device inside your body.
Loss of Enjoyment of Life: Compensation for your diminished ability to live a full and normal life due to physical limitations and constant fear.
Permanent Injury: Compensation for the fact that your body has been permanently and catastrophically altered.
Lost Earning Capacity: If your condition or treatment prevents you from working, you can claim for lost future wages.
Key Evidence to Obtain
Supporting Rhode Island Statute:
Chapter 5-37.3: Confidentiality of Health Care Communications and Information Act: Your attorney will use the legal process under this act to obtain all necessary evidence, including:
Your complete medical chart.
The signed consent form.
Hospital records proving their receipt of the FDA advisory.
Hospital policies and procedures (or lack thereof) for tracking implantable devices.
