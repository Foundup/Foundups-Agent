  - ✅ [Validation:Pytest] - All 285 tests pass (4 skipped async tests due to missing pytest-asyncio)
  - 🎯 [Milestone:Clean4] - Achieved working version of clean4 with full test coverage and functional main application

- Version: 0.3.6
- Date: 2025-04-29
- Git Tag: N/A (Integration performed in 1_WSP_Test environment)
- Description: Resolved smoke test blockers (WSP 7.1) related to `StreamResolver` import and subsequent `SyntaxError`.
- Notes: Encountered persistent file system/environment inconsistencies preventing reliable edits via standard tools. Resolved by forcefully overwriting `main.py` and `modules/stream_resolver/__init__.py` with correct content via PowerShell script, removing the non-existent `StreamResolver` import/export, and clearing `__pycache__`. Smoke test (`main.py`) now executes past import/syntax errors but fails on authentication (`invalid_grant: Bad Request`), which is expected if credentials in `1_WSP_Test` are invalid/expired.
- Features/Fixes/Changes:
  - 🔧 [Fix:main.py] - Corrected import statement for `modules.stream_resolver` (removed non-existent `StreamResolver`).
  - 🔧 [Fix:stream_resolver] - Corrected `__init__.py` to not export non-existent `StreamResolver`.
  - 🔧 [Fix:main.py] - Resolved `SyntaxError` potentially introduced during file overwrite attempts.
  - ✅ [Validation:WSP_7.1] - Smoke test now executes past initial import/syntax errors.
  - ⚠️ [Runtime:Auth] - Smoke test fails during runtime due to authentication errors (`invalid_grant`).
