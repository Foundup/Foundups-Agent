## MODLOG - [+UPDATES]:

- Version: 0.1.7
- Description: Resolved numerous test failures (40+) across youtube_auth, token_manager, livechat, live_chat_processor after module refactoring (src layout) and async implementation.
- Notes: Addressed issues with mocking, patch targets, async handling (pytest-asyncio), logging assertions, and test logic (e.g., trigger sequence checks). Cleaned up test file structure.
- Features:
  - Corrected patch targets for refactored code.
  - Integrated pytest-asyncio for proper async test execution.
  - Resolved async/await mismatches in application code and tests.
  - Fixed mock assertion logic (double calls, logging, rate limits).
  - Achieved 100% passing tests (42/42).
  - Standardized module structure (using src/).
  - Removed placeholder comments from ModLog.md.

- Version: 0.1.6
- Description:
  - Removed dead import: `StreamResolver` from `live_chat_processor`.
  - Cleaned `__all__` in `stream_resolver/__init__.py` to reflect actual exports.
  - Fixed failing test: `test_message_sending` by isolating mock with `reset_mock()`.
- Notes:
  - Verified `StreamResolver` was unused and non-existent.
  - Confirmed test isolation fixed false positive on `insert()` call count.
  - All 8 `live_chat_processor` tests now pass.
- Features:
  - Cleaner import structure
  - Accurate mock test handling
  - Improved module isolation

- Version: 0.1.5
- Description: Fixed [OAuthManager]/[StreamResolver] credential rotation loop and locked StreamResolver module.
- Notes: Resolved issue where exhausted credentials weren't properly put into cooldown, causing infinite loops. Implemented external rotation orchestration via main.py. StreamResolver logic (based on clean3 + fix) is now considered canonical and should not be overwritten without WSP flag.
- Features:
  - Correct credential rotation upon quota exhaustion (403 errors).
  - Cooldown mechanism for exhausted credential sets.
  - External rotation control flow managed by main.py.
  - Added QuotaExceededError exception in StreamResolver.
  - Passed Credentials object to LiveChatListener to fix startup error.
  - Manual guard requested for modules/stream_resolver/src/stream_resolver.py against overwrites.

- Version: 0.1.4
- Description: Added [Windsurf Protocol] (WSP) to Prototype phase
- Notes: Integrated WSP development framework into project infrastructure
- Features:
  - WSP task format and conventions
  - WSP+ prefix for TODO list additions
  - Strict modification boundaries
  - Reference baseline comparison
  - ModLog integration
  - Version tracking
  - Validation requirements
  - [+todo] commit convention

- Version: 0.1.3
- Description: Added [TODO] section and [+todo] convention to ModLog
- Notes: Centralized task tracking within ModLog.md. Use `[+todo]` convention for future additions.
- Features:
  - Dedicated TODO section with standardized format
  - [+todo] commit convention for task additions
  - Priority-based task organization
  - Memory system audit task with detailed subtasks
  - Assignee and due date tracking support

- Version: 0.0.9
- Description: Updated [ModLog] to remove dates and improve versioning
- Notes: Removed date handling and updated header structure
- Features:
  - Removed date-based sorting
  - Updated header structure
  - Added features list support
  - Improved versioning pattern
  - Added versioning documentation

- Version: 0.0.8
- Description: Fixed [ModLog] entry ordering to maintain descending chronological order

- Description: Added improved utility module for automatic [ModLog] updates
- Notes: Initial implementation with basic functionality

- Version: 0.0.3
- Description: Added utility module for automatic [ModLog] updates
- Notes: Initial implementation with basic functionality
