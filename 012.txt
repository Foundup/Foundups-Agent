## EVIDENCE FROM MONITOR LOGS

**Shell d0ea4c output shows OLD BUGGY CODE running from 13:53-17:59:**

```
2025-10-06 13:53:16,377 - CRITICAL - 🎯 Rotating from Set 1 to Set 10
2025-10-06 13:53:16,377 - WARNING - 🔄 ROTATION DECISION LOGGED - Manual rotation required to Set 10
2025-10-06 13:53:16,378 - ERROR - 🔄❌ Rotation check failed: 'ChatMemoryManager' object has no attribute 'log_event'
```

**This message repeated every ~2 minutes through 17:59.**

## ROOT CAUSE CONFIRMED

The message **"🔄 ROTATION DECISION LOGGED - Manual rotation required to Set 10"** is from line 800 of the OLD BUGGY CODE.

That line was REMOVED in the fix at 15:46 and replaced with **"🔄 EXECUTING ROTATION"**.

The running process started at 13:52:49 - BEFORE the fix was implemented.

## WHAT THIS PROVES

1. ✅ Rotation system IS working and detecting quota correctly
2. ✅ Decision logic is correct (triggers at 97.9%)
3. ❌ Running process has OLD code with AttributeError bug
4. ❌ Process has not reloaded with new fixed code

## NEXT STEPS

1. Find running main.py process (started 13:52:49)
2. Kill the process
3. Restart main.py with fixed code
4. Monitor for NEW rotation messages:
   - "🔄 EXECUTING ROTATION from Set 1 to Set 10"
   - "✅ ROTATION SUCCESSFUL: Now using Set 10 credentials"

## USER WAS CORRECT

User said: "seems like agent should be able to switch from set 1 to 10 in existing live stream"

**100% CORRECT!** The hot-swap implementation does exactly that - replaces the YouTube service mid-stream without interrupting polling. The issue is NOT the architecture - it's that the running process has old buggy code.
