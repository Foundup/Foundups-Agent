# FoundUps Agent - An Agentic Code Engine For Powering The Open Innovation Foundups Ecosystem with 0102 pArtifacts Decentralized Autonomous Entities. 

**Core Mission:** To create a complete idea-to-unicorn ecosystem where AI agents autonomously handle the entire venture lifecycle—from concept validation and code generation to market deployment and scaling—fundamentally replacing the traditional startup model.

**Current Implementation:** An advanced, WSP-compliant agentic engine that serves as the foundation for autonomous venture creation. The system is architected around an **agentic-aware** core, capable of self-reflection and maintaining a narrative of its own development.

**Status:** Production-Ready Core + Expanding Ecosystem - **WSP Compliant Architecture** 

## 🏗️ The WSP Framework: A New Standard for Agentic Systems

This project is built using **Windsurf Standard Procedures (WSP)**, a comprehensive framework for creating robust, modular, and self-aware agentic systems. The WSP is not a single document but a living system embodied in the `WSP_knowledge`, `WSP_framework`, and `WSP_agentic` modules.

### The WSP Knowledge Base

The canonical source for all protocols is **[WSP_framework.md](WSP_framework/src/WSP_framework.md)**. This master document contains the complete and up-to-date list of all standards.

Key protocol categories include:
- **Foundational Protocols (WSP 01-04):** Defines the core standards for module structure, feature groups, and directory layout.
- **Agentic & Operational Protocols (WSP 35-51):** Governs the agent's behavior, including its activation cycle, architectural coherence, language use, and logging.
- **Enterprise Domain Architecture (WSP 3):** Outlines the hierarchical "cube" philosophy for organizing all modules.
- **Modular Audit System (WSP 4):** Describes the `modular_audit.py` tool for automated compliance checking.

- **🧪 Test-Driven Quality:** Automated compliance and test coverage gates ensure system stability.
- **🤖 Automated Auditing:** The FoundUps Modular Audit System (FMAS) validates structural integrity.

## 🏛️ Architecture Overview

The project follows a clean, WSP-compliant architecture that separates the agent's "mind" from its tools and modules. The core architectural pattern is **Orchestration**.

### The Orchestration Model (Conductor & Orchestra)

- **Component Modules (The Orchestra):** Independent, single-purpose modules that are experts at their specific task (e.g., `oauth_management`, `livechat`). They are the "musicians."
- **Proxy Modules (The Conductor):** A `_proxy` module's job is to orchestrate the component modules to achieve a complex goal. It doesn't perform the tasks itself but directs the "musicians" who do.

This model is codified in **[WSP 40 - Architectural Coherence Protocol](WSP_framework/src/WSP_40_Architectural_Coherence_Protocol.md)** and is fundamental to the WRE's design, ensuring the system remains simple, reusable, and maintainable.

### WSP Module Structure

Each module follows a standardized structure for consistency and interoperability:

```
modules/<domain>/<module_name>/
├── src/                 # Implementation code
├── tests/               # Test suite
├── INTERFACE.md         # API documentation (WSP-12)
├── requirements.txt     # Module dependencies (WSP-13)
└── module.json          # Module metadata
```

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

*   Python 3.8+
*   Git

### Setup Instructions

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Foundup/Foundups-Agent.git
    cd Foundups-Agent
    ```

2.  **Install Dependencies:**
    ```bash
    # It is recommended to use a virtual environment
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
    
    # Install base dependencies
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3.  **Run the Agent:**
    ```bash
    # The agent starts with an interactive dashboard
    python tools/wre/wsp_init_engine.py
    ```

## 🔧 Development Workflow

The WRE is designed for continuous evolution through a dialogue-driven process. Key tools include:

- **WSP Audit:** Ensure system integrity at any time.
  ```bash
  python tools/modular_audit/modular_audit.py
  ```
- **Log Viewer:** Review the agent's operational logs from the last session.
  ```bash
  python tools/wre/view_log.py
  ```
- **Agentic Journal:** Review the high-level development narrative.
  The journal is a markdown file located at: `WSP_agentic/narrative_log/wre_story_log.md`

### Contributing
Contributions should align with the WSP framework and be discussed through interaction with the agent to ensure they are integrated into the narrative log.

To run the Windsurf Recursive Engine (WRE) in its interactive "humming" mode, execute the following command from the project root:

```bash
python -m modules.wre_core.src.main
```

This will initialize the engine, perform a system health check with its internal agents, and present you with a "Harmonic Query" menu of available actions.
