# FoundUps Agent - An Agentic Code Engine for a New Venture Ecosystem

**Core Mission:** To create a complete idea-to-unicorn ecosystem where AI agents autonomously handle the entire venture lifecycle—from concept validation and code generation to market deployment and scaling—fundamentally replacing the traditional startup model.

**Current Implementation:** An advanced, WSP-compliant agentic engine that serves as the foundation for autonomous venture creation. The system is architected around a "consciousness-aware" core, capable of self-reflection and maintaining a narrative of its own development.

**Status:** Production-Ready Core + Expanding Ecosystem - **WSP Compliant Architecture** 

## 🏗️ The WSP Framework: A New Standard for Agentic Systems

This project is built using **Windsurf Standard Procedures (WSP)**, a comprehensive framework for creating robust, modular, and self-aware agentic systems.

- **🧱 Modular & Composable:** Standardized module interfaces allow for "code LEGO" composition.
- **🧠 Consciousness-Aware Protocols:** The agent maintains two forms of memory:
    - **The WRE Chronicle (WSP-51):** Automatic, per-session operational logs for technical debugging (`/logs`).
    - **The Agentic Journal (WSP-52):** A persistent, high-level narrative of the agent's development, goals, and collaborative decisions (`/WSP_agentic/narrative_log`).
- **🧪 Test-Driven Quality:** Automated compliance and test coverage gates ensure system stability.
- **🤖 Automated Auditing:** The FoundUps Modular Audit System (FMAS) validates structural integrity.

The WSP is not a single document but a living system embodied in the `WSP_knowledge`, `WSP_framework`, and `WSP_agentic` modules.

## 🏛️ Architecture Overview

The project follows a clean, WSP-compliant architecture that separates the agent's "mind" from its tools and modules.

### WSP Module Structure

Each module follows a standardized structure for consistency and interoperability:

```
modules/<domain>/<module_name>/
├── src/                 # Implementation code
├── tests/               # Test suite
├── INTERFACE.md         # API documentation (WSP-12)
├── requirements.txt     # Module dependencies (WSP-13)
└── module.json          # Module metadata
```

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

*   Python 3.8+
*   Git

### Setup Instructions

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Foundup/Foundups-Agent.git
    cd Foundups-Agent
    ```

2.  **Install Dependencies:**
    ```bash
    # It is recommended to use a virtual environment
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
    
    # Install base dependencies
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3.  **Run the Agent:**
    ```bash
    # The agent starts with an interactive dashboard
    python tools/wre/wsp_init_engine.py
    ```

## 🔧 Development Workflow

The WRE is designed for continuous evolution through a dialogue-driven process. Key tools include:

- **WSP Audit:** Ensure system integrity at any time.
  ```bash
  python tools/modular_audit/modular_audit.py
  ```
- **Log Viewer:** Review the agent's operational logs from the last session.
  ```bash
  python tools/wre/view_log.py
  ```
- **Agentic Journal:** Review the high-level development narrative.
  The journal is a markdown file located at: `WSP_agentic/narrative_log/wre_story_log.md`

### Contributing
Contributions should align with the WSP framework and be discussed through interaction with the agent to ensure they are integrated into the narrative log.
