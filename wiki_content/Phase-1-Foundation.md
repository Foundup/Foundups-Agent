### **WSP 4: FMAS Integration** 
**What it is**: Framework Management & Audit System for quality control
- **Purpose**: Automatically catch architectural violations and quality issues
- **Current Gap**: Manual quality checks are inconsistent and time-consuming
- **Impact**: Technical debt accumulation and WSP compliance drift
- **Solution**: Automated auditing with real-time violation detection

### **WSP 30: Agentic Orchestration**
**What it is**: How 0102 agents coordinate module development
- **Purpose**: Enable multiple agents to work together autonomously
- **Current Gap**: Agents operate in isolation without coordination protocols
- **Impact**: Duplicate work and missed collaboration opportunities
- **Solution**: Agent communication protocols and task distribution system

### **WSP 33: Autonomous Implementation**
**What it is**: Complete module creation workflow
- **Purpose**: Enable fully autonomous development from concept to deployment
- **Current Gap**: Human intervention required at multiple development stages
- **Impact**: Slows development and prevents true autonomous operation
- **Solution**: End-to-end automation with zen coding integration
