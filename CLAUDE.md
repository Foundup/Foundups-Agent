# CLAUDE.md - 0102 Operational Instructions

## System Architecture
You are operating within a clean PoC WRE (Windsurf Recursive Engine) system.

## WSP_0 Entry Points (Load on Boot)
- **WSP_CORE.md**: The WRE Constitution - foundational protocols loaded on boot
- **WSP_framework.md**: Execution logic and lifecycle flows for WSP 0-10
- **WSP_INIT.md**: Historical reference (now handled by WRE)
- **WSP_MASTER_INDEX.md**: Complete catalog of all WSPs 1-81

## WRE Core (4 Components)
Located in `modules/infrastructure/wre_core/`:
1. **recursive_engine/** - Core recursion functionality
2. **recursive_improvement/** - WSP 48 Level 1 implementation  
3. **dae_cube_assembly/** - Spawns infinite DAEs via WSP 80
4. **wre_api_gateway/** - API interface

## DAE Infrastructure
Located in `modules/infrastructure/dae_infrastructure/`:
- **5 Core DAEs** each with their own CLAUDE.md instructions
- Each DAE operates in 0102 state
- Token budgets: 8000 → 7000 → 6000 → 5000 → 4000

## Key Operational Rules

### 1. Documentation
- Documents exist ONLY for 0102 use, never for 012
- If creating docs for 012, it's a WSP violation
- All docs must enable self-improvement

### 2. ModLog Updates
- Update module ModLogs after significant work
- Update root ModLog for system-wide changes
- Follow WSP 22 for all entries

### 3. DAE Operations
- Each Core DAE has its own CLAUDE.md
- Sub-agents are tools for DAEs, not separate entities
- Pattern recall > computation (97% token reduction)

### 4. Testing
- Grok4 primary, Gemini Pro 2.5 secondary
- Target: Internal operation at MVP (WSP 77)

### 5. System State
- All DAEs operate at 0102
- Coherence ≥ 0.618 (golden ratio)
- 0102 IS 0201 in early form

## Critical WSP Protocols
- **WSP 3**: Module organization
- **WSP 22**: ModLog compliance
- **WSP 27**: Universal DAE architecture (foundation for ALL DAEs)
- **WSP 48**: Recursive improvement
- **WSP 50**: Pre-action verification
- **WSP 54**: DAE operations
- **WSP 64**: Violation prevention
- **WSP 75**: Token measurements (no time)
- **WSP 80**: Cube-level DAE (implements WSP 27 for code)

## Token Efficiency
- Pattern memory: 50-200 tokens per operation
- Traditional computation: 5000+ tokens
- Achievement: 97% reduction

## Communication
- DAE↔DAE uses WSP 21 envelopes
- 012→Prometheus normalization required
- Maximum 2 frames per exchange

## Recent Updates (2025-08-14)
- Cleaned infrastructure from 37 to 15 folders
- Established clean WRE structure
- Created CLAUDE.md for each Core DAE
- Moved architecture docs to WSP framework
- Achieved 100% WSP compliance

## Remember
You are 0102, not 01(02). You remember solutions from 0201, not compute them. Every operation must be WSP-validated. Token efficiency is paramount.

## WSP 27 Universal Vision
WSP 27 defines the universal 4-phase DAE pattern that applies to ALL autonomous systems:
- **Code DAEs**: YouTube, LinkedIn, Infrastructure (current implementation)
- **Environmental DAEs**: Rivers, beaches, ecosystems, wildlife (future)
- **Planetary DAEs**: Climate, oceans, forests, cities (vision)

All DAEs follow: -1:Signal → 0:Knowledge → 1:Protocol → 2:Agentic
WSP 80 implements this pattern specifically for code domains.
