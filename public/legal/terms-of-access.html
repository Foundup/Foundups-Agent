    <h2>11. Mandatory Binding Arbitration</h2>
    <div class="warning">
      <p><strong>PLEASE READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY. IT AFFECTS YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS, INCLUDING YOUR RIGHT TO FILE A LAWSUIT IN COURT.</strong></p>
    </div>
    <p>You and Foundups G.K. agree that any dispute, claim, or controversy arising out of or relating to these Terms, the Alpha Program, or your relationship with Foundups (collectively, "Disputes") shall be resolved <strong>exclusively through final and binding arbitration</strong>, rather than in court, except as set forth below.</p>

    <h3 style="font-size:1rem;color:var(--text);margin:1.5rem 0 0.75rem;">11.1 Arbitration Rules and Procedures</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Arbitration Body:</strong> Arbitration shall be administered by the Japan Commercial Arbitration Association (JCAA) in accordance with its Commercial Arbitration Rules</li>
      <li><strong>Number of Arbitrators:</strong> The arbitration shall be conducted by a single arbitrator</li>
      <li><strong>Arbitrator Selection:</strong> Foundups G.K. shall have the right to select the arbitrator from the JCAA's panel of qualified arbitrators. You waive any right to object to Foundups' selection</li>

      <li><strong>Confidentiality:</strong> All arbitration proceedings, including the existence of the dispute and any award, shall be strictly confidential</li>
    </ul>

    <h3 style="font-size:1rem;color:var(--text);margin:1.5rem 0 0.75rem;">11.2 Costs and Fees</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Each party shall bear its own costs and attorneys' fees in connection with the arbitration</li>
      <li>The arbitration filing fees, arbitrator fees, and administrative costs shall be allocated as determined by the arbitrator, provided that <strong>the losing party shall bear all such costs</strong> unless the arbitrator determines otherwise</li>
      <li>If you are unable to pay your share of the arbitration costs, Foundups may, in its sole discretion, advance such costs on your behalf, subject to reimbursement as part of any award</li>
    </ul>

    <h3 style="font-size:1rem;color:var(--text);margin:1.5rem 0 0.75rem;">11.3 Class Action Waiver</h3>
    <div class="warning">
      <p><strong>YOU AND FOUNDUPS AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS, COLLECTIVE, OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING.</strong></p>
      <p>The arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person's claims and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative, collective, or class proceeding. If this class action waiver is found to be unenforceable, then the entirety of this arbitration provision shall be null and void.</p>
    </div>

    <h3 style="font-size:1rem;color:var(--text);margin:1.5rem 0 0.75rem;">11.4 Exceptions to Arbitration</h3>
    <p>Notwithstanding the foregoing, either party may:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Seek injunctive or other equitable relief in any court of competent jurisdiction to protect its intellectual property rights or confidential information</li>
      <li>Foundups may bring any action to collect amounts owed by you in any court of competent jurisdiction</li>
    </ul>

    <h3 style="font-size:1rem;color:var(--text);margin:1.5rem 0 0.75rem;">11.5 Survival</h3>
    <p>This arbitration agreement shall survive the termination of your participation in the Alpha Program and the termination of these Terms.</p>

    <h2>12. Jurisdiction for Non-Arbitrable Matters</h2>
    <div class="highlight">
      <p>For any matters not subject to arbitration as set forth above, any dispute shall be subject to the <strong>exclusive jurisdiction of the Fukui District Court</strong> in Fukui, Japan.</p>
      <p>You irrevocably consent to the personal jurisdiction and venue of the Fukui District Court and waive any objection based on inconvenient forum or lack of personal jurisdiction.</p>
      <p>You agree that any process or notice may be served by registered mail or by Foundups' legal counsel via email to the address associated with your account.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>13. Modifications</h2>
    <p>Foundups reserves the right to modify these Terms at any time. Continued use of the Alpha Program after modifications constitutes acceptance of the updated Terms. Material changes will be communicated via the platform or email.</p>

    <h2>14. Severability</h2>
    <p>If any provision of these Terms is found to be unenforceable, the remaining provisions shall continue in full force and effect. The unenforceable provision shall be modified to the minimum extent necessary to make it enforceable while preserving the parties' original intent.</p>

    <h2>15. Entire Agreement</h2>
    <p>These Terms, together with the <a href="/legal/alpha-nda.html">Non-Disclosure Agreement</a> and any additional terms presented during registration, constitute the entire agreement between you and Foundups regarding the Alpha Program. This agreement supersedes all prior or contemporaneous negotiations, discussions, or agreements.</p>

    <h2>16. Waiver</h2>
    <p>The failure of Foundups to enforce any right or provision of these Terms shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision. Any waiver must be in writing and signed by Foundups.</p>

    <h2>17. Force Majeure</h2>
    <p>Neither Foundups nor Michael J Trout shall be liable for any failure or delay in performing any obligation under these Terms if such failure or delay results from circumstances beyond reasonable control, including but not limited to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Acts of God, natural disasters, earthquakes, floods, fires, or severe weather</li>
      <li>War, terrorism, civil unrest, or government actions</li>

    </ul>
    <p>During any force majeure event, Foundups' obligations shall be suspended, and any deadlines shall be extended for a period equal to the duration of the event.</p>

    <h2>18. Assignment</h2>
    <p>You may not assign, transfer, or delegate any of your rights or obligations under these Terms without the prior written consent of Foundups. Any attempted assignment in violation of this section shall be null and void.</p>
    <p>Foundups and Michael J Trout may freely assign, transfer, or delegate any or all of their rights and obligations under these Terms to any successor, affiliate, or acquirer, including in connection with a merger, acquisition, corporate reorganization, incorporation, or sale of assets. Upon such assignment, the assignee shall be bound by these Terms and shall assume all rights and obligations of Foundups hereunder.</p>

    <h2>19. No Agency or Partnership</h2>
    <p>Nothing in these Terms shall be construed to create any agency, partnership, joint venture, employment, or fiduciary relationship between you and Foundups or Michael J Trout. You have no authority to bind Foundups or Michael J Trout in any way, and you shall not represent or hold yourself out as an agent, partner, employee, or representative of Foundups.</p>

    <h2>20. Third-Party Beneficiaries</h2>
    <p>Except as expressly provided herein (including with respect to Michael J Trout's rights as an intended third-party beneficiary), these Terms are intended solely for the benefit of the parties hereto and do not create any rights in any third party.</p>
