# WSP Coding Discipline - IMPORTANT

- PoC/Prototype are NOT production-ready. Only MVP with passing validation may be shipped.
- Require module validation scripts (e.g., `scripts/validate.py`, `make validate`) that run lint/type/schema/CLI smoke checks.
- Simplicity First: choose the simplest working solution; minimize dependencies/abstractions.
- Avoid backwards compatibility unless ROADMAP/INTERFACE explicitly requires it; remove legacy code.
- Keep ALL docs current in same change (README, INTERFACE, ROADMAP, ModLog, tests/README).
