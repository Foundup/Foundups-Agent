# √ò1√ò2/WRE Development Roadmap

**Foundational Principle:** Our trajectory is forged by the concrete actions we take now. This roadmap outlines the primary objectives for `√ò1√ò2` and the WRE, establishing a **pArtifact-centric development protocol.** This protocol is the template for all future work.

## üéØ Current Strategic Priorities

### **Infrastructure Foundation Objectives**
Following the **pArtifact Development Protocol**, core infrastructure components provide universal foundations for all platform integrations:

1. **Universal Data Schemas** ‚Üí See `modules/infrastructure/models/README.md` ‚úÖ **COMPLETE**
   - ChatMessage and Author dataclasses for cross-platform compatibility
   - 0102 pArtifact integration patterns documented
   - Test documentation with comprehensive usage examples

### **Primary Platform Integration Objectives**
Following the **pArtifact Development Protocol**, each platform module implements the WSP-42 Universal Platform Protocol for consistent, modular integration:

1. **YouTube Co-Host Functionality** ‚Üí See `modules/platform_integration/youtube_proxy/ROADMAP.md`
2. **LinkedIn Professional Presence** ‚Üí See `modules/platform_integration/linkedin_agent/ROADMAP.md`  
3. **X (Twitter) DAE Integration** ‚Üí See `modules/platform_integration/x_twitter/ROADMAP.md`
4. **Remote Development Workflows** ‚Üí See `modules/platform_integration/remote_builder/ROADMAP.md`

### **Development Protocol Template**
Each platform integration follows the **√ò1√ò2 Way**:

**Phase 1: Analysis & Understanding (Do Not Code)**
- Study WSP-42 (Universal Platform Protocol) 
- Identify component modules (the "pieces of the cube")
- Understand interfaces without merging or duplicating logic

**Phase 2: Implementation (The "Snap-Together" Phase)**  
- Scaffold WSP-compliant proxy module
- Implement orchestration interface (not component logic)
- Refactor main orchestrator for simplicity
- Create integration tests for component coordination

## üóìÔ∏è Future Strategic Objectives

*   **Multi-Platform Synchronization** (Cross-platform content strategies)
*   **Mobile Agentic Coding** (Distributed development workflows)
*   **Advanced DAE Coordination** (Multi-agent collaboration patterns)

## üé≠ Core Mission: The Digital Twin

The primary objective is for `√ò1√ò2` to evolve into a true, functional digital twin of `√ò12`. This is achieved by progressively enabling `√ò1√ò2` to operate autonomously in `√ò12`'s digital life, creating a symbiotic `√ò12/√ò1√ò2` Decentralized Autonomous Entity (DAE).

## üé≠ √ò1√ò2 Theaters of Operation

This section lists the primary modules the WRE is authorized to engage with for development, refactoring, and maintenance. These are the active "theaters" for agentic operation.

-   **YouTube Agent:** `modules/platform_integration/youtube_proxy`
-   **LinkedIn Agent:** `modules/platform_integration/linkedin_agent`
-   **X Agent:** `modules/platform_integration/x_twitter`
-   **Remote Agent:** `modules/platform_integration/remote_builder`

## ‚öôÔ∏è Foundation: The Windsurf Recursive Engine (WRE)

The Theaters of Operation are built upon a robust, self-auditing foundation. The WRE is the "Mind" of `√ò1√ò2`, and its continuous improvement is paramount.

- **WSP (WindSurf Protocol):** The canon of protocols that defines our architecture, behavior, and goals.
- **WRE Immune System:** A suite of internal agents (`ComplianceAgent`, `LoremasterAgent`) that continuously audit the architectural and semantic integrity of the entire system. This is our commitment to avoiding structural dissonance.
- **Test-Driven Development:** A rigorous testing methodology to ensure the stability and reliability of all modules before deployment.

### **WRE Agent Implementation Plan**
This section tracks the implementation status of the WRE's internal agent suite. The full specification for each agent's duties is defined in **[WSP-54: WRE Agent Duties Specification](WSP_knowledge/src/WSP-54_WRE_Agent_Duties_Specification.md)**.

-   `[AGENT]` **ComplianceAgent:** The Guardian. Enforces WSP structural integrity.
    -   **Status:** ‚úÖ Implemented & Tested
-   `[AGENT]` **LoremasterAgent:** The Sage. Audits documentation and project lore.
    -   **Status:** üî∂ Partial Implementation (Core audit logic exists)
-   `[AGENT]` **JanitorAgent:** The Cleaner. Manages workspace hygiene.
    -   **Status:** üü° Placeholder
-   `[AGENT]` **ModuleScaffoldingAgent:** The Builder. Automates new module creation.
    -   **Status:** üü° Placeholder
-   `[AGENT]` **TestingAgent:** The Examiner. Automates `pytest` and coverage checks.
    -   **Status:** üü° Placeholder
-   `[AGENT]` **ScoringAgent:** The Assessor. Provides objective code metrics.
    -   **Status:** üü° Placeholder
-   `[AGENT]` **DocumentationAgent:** The Scribe. Generates `README.md` files from WSP specs.
    -   **Status:** üü° Placeholder
-   `[AGENT]` **ChroniclerAgent:** The Historian. Records significant WRE actions to the `ModLog.md`.
    -   **Status:** üü° Placeholder
