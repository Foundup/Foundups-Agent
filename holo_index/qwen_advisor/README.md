# Qwen Advisor - AI Intelligence System

## Overview
The Qwen Advisor provides intelligent AI-powered guidance for HoloIndex searches, combining multiple intelligence sources to deliver comprehensive WSP compliance coaching.

## Purpose
Transform HoloIndex from keyword search to **intelligent AI assistant** that:
- Understands code context with LLM analysis
- Provides WSP protocol guidance
- Detects behavioral patterns for coaching
- Learns from user interactions

## Architecture

### Core Components

#### 1. **advisor.py** - Multi-Source Intelligence Synthesis
Combines all intelligence sources:
- LLM analysis (Qwen-Coder 1.5B)
- WSP Master protocol guidance
- Rules engine compliance checking
- Pattern coach behavioral detection

#### 2. **llm_engine.py** - LLM Integration
- Loads Qwen-Coder 1.5B GGUF model
- Provides code context analysis
- Generates intelligent recommendations
- ~500ms inference time

#### 3. **wsp_master.py** - WSP Protocol Intelligence
- Loads all 95+ WSP protocols
- Intelligent protocol selection
- Risk assessment and compliance checking
- Protocol relationship mapping

#### 4. **pattern_coach.py** - Behavioral Coaching
- Detects user behavior patterns
- Provides contextual interventions
- Learns from coaching effectiveness
- Replaces time-based reminders

#### 5. **rules_engine.py** - Compliance Engine
- Rule-based compliance checking
- Fallback for when LLM unavailable
- Structured guidance generation
- WSP violation detection

#### 6. **vibecoding_assessor.py** - Anti-Vibecoding System
- Tracks code creation patterns
- Calculates vibecoding scores
- Provides improvement recommendations
- Pattern-based detection (deprecated for time-based)

#### 7. **agent_detection.py** - Environment Detection
- Detects if running as 0102 agent
- Auto-enables advisor for agents
- Environment-aware configuration

- Tracks effectiveness metrics
- Improves over time

## Usage

### Basic Advisor
```python
from holo_index.qwen_advisor.advisor import QwenAdvisor, AdvisorContext

advisor = QwenAdvisor()
context = AdvisorContext(query, code_hits, wsp_hits)
result = advisor.generate_guidance(context)
```

### Pattern Coach
```python
from holo_index.qwen_advisor.pattern_coach import PatternCoach

coach = PatternCoach()
coaching = coach.analyze_and_coach(query, results, warnings)
```

### WSP Master
```python
from holo_index.qwen_advisor.wsp_master import WSPMaster

master = WSPMaster()
analysis = master.analyze_query(query, code_hits)
```

## Performance Metrics
- **LLM Load Time**: ~2 seconds (first load)
- **Inference Time**: ~500ms per query
- **Pattern Detection**: <50ms
- **WSP Analysis**: <100ms
- **Total Latency**: <1 second end-to-end

## WSP Compliance
- **WSP 35**: HoloIndex Qwen Advisor Plan
- **WSP 84**: Code Memory Verification
- **WSP 50**: Pre-Action Verification
- **WSP 87**: Code Navigation Protocol
