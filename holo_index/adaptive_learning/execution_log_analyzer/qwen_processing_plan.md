## EXECUTION PROTOCOL

### Processing Rules
1. **Chunk Size**: Process exactly 1,000 lines per chunk
2. **Analysis Depth**: Apply full framework to each chunk
3. **Recursive Learning**: Use insights from previous chunks to improve next ones
4. **Pattern Focus**: Identify both explicit and implicit patterns
5. **Holo Relevance**: Always consider "How can HoloDAE use this?"

### Quality Assurance
- **Completeness**: Every chunk gets full analysis framework
- **Cross-References**: Link related patterns across chunks
- **Actionability**: Every insight must have HoloDAE application
- **Measurability**: Quantify impact of each learning

### Communication Protocol
- **Clear Structure**: Use exact output formats specified
- **Progress Tracking**: Report completion of each phase/chunk
- **Issue Flagging**: Immediately report any processing difficulties
- **Recursive Feedback**: Suggest improvements to processing approach

---

## SUCCESS CRITERIA

- **Complete Processing**: All 23,000+ lines analyzed
- **Pattern Extraction**: 50+ reusable components identified
- **Holo Integration**: Specific enhancement plan created
- **Measurable Impact**: Quantified improvements for HoloDAE
- **Scalability Proof**: Methodology works for logs of any size

## EMERGENCY PROTOCOLS

**If Token Limit Reached**:
1. Save current progress with exact line number
2. Summarize learnings achieved so far
3. Provide continuation plan for next session
4. Flag any critical insights discovered

**If Processing Errors**:
1. Document exact error and context
2. Provide alternative processing approach
3. Preserve all work completed
4. Suggest librarian intervention if needed
