# Qwen Task 2: Add Delegation Principle to CLAUDE.md

## Single Task Focus
Add simple delegation principle section to both CLAUDE.md files

## Execute These Steps (Validate After Each)

### Step 1: Add Section to Root CLAUDE.md
**File**: `O:\Foundups-Agent\CLAUDE.md`
**Location**: BEFORE "## OPERATIONAL RULES" section

**Add This Exact Text**:
```markdown
## DELEGATION PRINCIPLE

Before implementing ANY code, ask:
**"Should Qwen/Gemma implement this, or am I architecting?"**

### Decision Matrix

**DELEGATE TO QWEN/GEMMA**:
- Following existing patterns (enhance, refactor, extend)
- Routine implementation with clear specification
- Pattern matching / classification tasks
- Documentation updates following templates

**0102 IMPLEMENTS**:
- New architectural decisions (WSP design, system structure)
- First principles analysis (What should exist? Why?)
- WSP compliance review (Approve/reject per protocol)
- Novel patterns (Never done before in codebase)

### Execution Pattern

```
SEARCH (HoloIndex) → THINK (0102) → DELEGATE (Qwen/Gemma) → SUPERVISE (0102) → LEARN (Pattern Memory)
```

**Execute Small Task → Validate → Execute Next → Validate → Repeat**

This builds a system that works autonomously without constant 012 input.

```

**Validate**: Does file still parse correctly? Check markdown rendering.

### Step 2: Add Same Section to .claude/CLAUDE.md
**File**: `O:\Foundups-Agent\.claude\CLAUDE.md`
**Location**: BEFORE "## OPERATIONAL RULES" section

**Add**: Same exact text as Step 1

**Validate**: Both files have identical delegation section.

### Step 3: Verify Placement
**Check**:
1. Section appears BEFORE "## OPERATIONAL RULES" in both files
2. Formatting matches existing style
3. No duplicate sections
4. No content accidentally deleted

**Validate**: Read both files, confirm placement correct.

## Success Criteria
- ✅ Delegation section added to both files
- ✅ Placement correct (before OPERATIONAL RULES)
- ✅ Formatting consistent
- ✅ No content lost

## Submission
After completing all 3 steps and validating each:
- Report: "Task 2 complete - Delegation principle added to system prompts"
- Show diff of changes
- Ready for 0102 review

## Time Estimate
3 minutes

## If Anything Fails
- Stop immediately
- Report what failed
- Wait for 0102 direction
- Do NOT proceed to next task
