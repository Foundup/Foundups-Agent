## Why These Were Archived

**Completed Implementations**: Work is done, docs preserve historical record but aren't needed for daily reference.

**Analyses**: Foundational thinking completed, conclusions integrated into active architecture.

**Design Documents**: Designs implemented, living documentation (README, INTERFACE) reflects current state.

**Training Missions**: Training complete, patterns learned and integrated.

**Status Reports**: Point-in-time snapshots, superseded by current ModLog and status docs.

**Obsolete Plans**: Features implemented or approaches abandoned, no longer actionable.
