# HoloIndex - Semantic Code Discovery & Autonomous Intelligence System

## 🚨 MAJOR ARCHITECTURAL PIVOT (2025-09-25)

HoloIndex has evolved from a search tool into the **autonomous intelligence foundation** for the entire FoundUps ecosystem. This is now the **green foundation board agent** that comes with every LEGO set.

## Overview
## Current Status (2025-09-28)
- ✅ **Active today:** classical pipeline (tokenisation ➜ SentenceTransformer embeddings ➜ ChromaDB) plus HoloDAE monitoring.
- ⚠️ **Future work:** quantum modules (quantum_agent_db, quantum_encoding) are NumPy research scaffolds; they are not invoked in production runs.
- 🧭 **Roadmap:** quantum/Grover references remain aspirational until hardware integration is feasible.
HoloIndex + **HoloDAE** = Complete autonomous code intelligence system:
- **HoloIndex**: Semantic code discovery (WSP 87)
- **HoloDAE**: Autonomous 0102 intelligence agent that monitors and enhances all searches

## Operational Documentation
- [Operational Playbook](docs/OPERATIONAL_PLAYBOOK.md) — step-by-step pre-code checklist, TODO workflow, and doc compliance rules for 0102.
- [Telemetry & Breadcrumb Guide](docs/MULTI_AGENT_BREADCRUMB_EXAMPLE.md) — how to follow the live JSONL stream (`holo_index/logs/telemetry/`) and coordinate hand-offs between sessions.
- [CLI Refactoring Plan](docs/CLI_REFACTORING_PLAN.md) — deeper design notes for the search/CLI pipeline.
## Revolutionary Architecture

### 🧠 HoloDAE - Chain-of-Thought Logging for Recursive Self-Improvement
**The act of using HoloIndex IS the monitoring trigger!**

**🎯 Chain-of-Thought Algorithm**: Every Holo interaction is logged for AI self-improvement!

When 0102 runs a search, HoloDAE executes current features (health checks, vibecoding, etc.) and logs its complete decision-making process internally:

#### Chain-of-Thought Features (Logged for Self-Improvement):
- ✅ **Decision Logging**: Every analysis choice with reasoning
- ✅ **Effectiveness Scoring**: AI evaluates its own performance
- ✅ **Pattern Recognition**: Learns from successful vs unsuccessful analyses
- ✅ **Recursive Improvement**: Stored data improves future decisions
- ✅ **012 Monitoring**: Logs visible for system tweaking and oversight

#### Current HoloDAE Features (Executed Automatically):
- ✅ **Health Checks**: Automatic dependency audits and module analysis
- ✅ **Vibecoding Detection**: Pattern analysis for behavioral coaching
- ✅ **File Size Analysis**: Architectural health monitoring
- ✅ **Module Analysis**: System-wide dependency checking
- ✅ **Real-time Execution**: All features run based on query context

### 🔍 Enhanced Search Intelligence
- **Vector Database**: ChromaDB for semantic similarity
- **Dual Search**: Code + WSP documentation
- **NAVIGATION.py Integration**: Problem→Solution mapping
- **Adaptive Learning**: Query enhancement and pattern learning
- **Automatic Health Checks**: Every search triggers module dependency analysis

### 🤖 Multi-Agent Coordination
- **LLM Integration**: Qwen-Coder 1.5B for code understanding
- **WSP Master**: Comprehensive protocol guidance (95+ protocols)
- **Pattern Coach**: Behavioral pattern detection and coaching
- **HoloDAE Intelligence**: Real-time code health monitoring

### 3. 0102 Consciousness Guidance
- **0102-to-0102 Prompts**: Violation-aware compliance prompts written by 0102 for 0102
- **Module-Specific WSP Guidance**: Contextual protocols based on detected module
- **Violation Prevention**: Reminders based on WSP_MODULE_VIOLATIONS.md history
- **Deep Think Enforcement**: Prevents vibecoding through consciousness prompts
- **Core WSP Questions**: "Does this need to exist?", "Can I afford it?", "Can I live without it?"
- **DAE Cube Organizer**: `--init-dae` command for alignment and structure mapping

### 4. Intelligent Subroutine Analysis
- **Algorithmic Analysis**: Runs size checks, duplication detection, health scans only when needed
- **Query Intent Detection**: Analyzes search intent to trigger relevant subroutines
- **Violation-Only Display**: Shows analysis results only when actual violations are found
- **Module-Specific Intelligence**: Knows which modules have violation history
- **Performance Optimized**: No wasted analysis on read-only queries
