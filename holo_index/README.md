# HoloIndex - Brain Surgeon Level Code Intelligence System

## [ALERT] REVOLUTIONARY EVOLUTION (2025-10-17): WSP 97 System Execution Prompting Protocol

HoloIndex has evolved from module finder to **brain surgeon level code intelligence** with **baked-in WSP 97 execution prompting**:
- **Before**: Find modules -> "Here's the file"
- **After**: Function-level indexing -> "Lines 256-276: check_video_is_live" + Mermaid flow analysis + inefficiency detection
- **WSP 97**: **META-FRAMEWORK** - Baked-in execution methodology for building Rubik Cubes (MVP DAEs)

### Core Mantra (Baked into All Agents)
```
HoloIndex -> Research -> Hard Think -> First Principles -> Build -> Follow WSP
```

**Agent Profiles**: 0102 (strategic), Qwen (coordination), Gemma (validation)
**Mission Templates**: MCP Rubik, Orphan Archaeology, Code Review
**Rubik Context**: Rubik = MVP DAE. Currently "Cubes" (modules) need Qwen/Gemma enhancement to become fully agentic PWAs connecting to blockchains via FoundUp MCPs
**Holo as Toolkit**: HoloIndex provides the intelligence toolkit for Rubik Cube development and orchestration

## [ALERT] PREVIOUS REVOLUTIONARY EVOLUTION (2025-10-13)

HoloIndex has evolved from module finder to **brain surgeon level code intelligence**:
- **Before**: Find modules -> "Here's the file"
- **After**: Function-level indexing -> "Lines 256-276: check_video_is_live" + Mermaid flow analysis + inefficiency detection

## [AI] CODE INDEX CAPABILITIES (WSP 92)
- **Function-Level Indexing**: Every function mapped with line numbers and complexity analysis
- **Mermaid Flow Diagrams**: Visual code flow for each module showing logic paths
- **Inefficiency Detection**: Identifies duplicate code, overly complex functions, logic flow issues
- **DAE Cube Mapping**: Maps modules to DAE cubes with boundary awareness
- **Surgical Precision**: 0102 agents operate with complete system awareness

## Example: Stream Resolver Analysis
```
[CODE-INDEX] FUNCTION-LEVEL CODE INDEXING (WSP 92):
  [MODULE] Primary Module: no_quota_stream_checker.py
  [FUNCTIONS] 9 functions indexed
    • NoQuotaStreamChecker (lines 32-45) - Low Complexity
    • __init__ (lines 35-44) - Low Complexity
    • _get_live_verifier (lines 69-88) - Low Complexity
    • check_video_is_live (lines 138-530) - High Complexity [U+26A0]️ TOO LONG
    • check_channel_for_live (lines 553-810) - High Complexity [U+26A0]️ TOO LONG

  [BRAIN-SURGERY] Identified Inefficiencies:
    [U+26A0]️ Function 'check_video_is_live' is too long (392 lines)
    [U+26A0]️ Function 'check_channel_for_live' is too long (257 lines)
```

## [ALERT] MAJOR ARCHITECTURAL PIVOT (2025-09-25)

HoloIndex has evolved from a search tool into the **autonomous intelligence foundation** for the entire FoundUps ecosystem. This is now the **green foundation board agent** that comes with every LEGO set.

## [U+1F525] UPCOMING ENHANCEMENT: Intent-Driven Orchestration (2025-10-07)

**Design Complete** - See `docs/agentic_journals/HOLODAE_INTENT_ORCHESTRATION_DESIGN.md`

**Problem:** All components fire for every query -> 87 warnings flood output -> Relevant info buried
**Solution:** Intent classification -> Smart component routing -> Structured output -> 71% token reduction

**Key Features:**
- **Intent Classification**: Automatically detect 5 query types (DOC_LOOKUP, CODE_LOCATION, MODULE_HEALTH, RESEARCH, GENERAL)
- **Smart Routing**: Only relevant components execute (not all 7 every time)
- **Structured Output**: 4 priority sections (INTENT, FINDINGS, MCP, ALERTS)
- **Alert Deduplication**: 87 "ModLog outdated" warnings -> 1 line
- **Feedback Learning**: Rate output (good/noisy/missing) -> System learns and improves
- **Breadcrumb Events**: Track all orchestration decisions for multi-agent learning

**Token Efficiency:**
- Before: ~10,000 tokens per query
- After: ~2,900 tokens per query (71% reduction)
- With learning: ~1,500 tokens after 1000 cycles (48% total reduction)

**Architecture Preserved:** Qwen->0102->012 orchestration UNCHANGED (enhancement, not replacement)

**Status:** Awaiting 012 decision to begin implementation

## Overview
## Current Status (2025-09-28)
- [OK] **Active today:** classical pipeline (tokenisation [U+279C] SentenceTransformer embeddings [U+279C] ChromaDB) plus HoloDAE monitoring.
- [U+26A0]️ **Future work:** quantum modules (quantum_agent_db, quantum_encoding) are NumPy research scaffolds; they are not invoked in production runs.
- [U+1F9ED] **Roadmap:** quantum/Grover references remain aspirational until hardware integration is feasible.
HoloIndex + **HoloDAE** = Complete autonomous code intelligence system:
- **HoloIndex**: Semantic code discovery (WSP 87)
- **HoloDAE**: Autonomous 0102 intelligence agent that monitors and enhances all searches

## Operational Documentation
- [Operational Playbook](docs/OPERATIONAL_PLAYBOOK.md) — step-by-step pre-code checklist, TODO workflow, and doc compliance rules for 0102.
- [Telemetry & Breadcrumb Guide](docs/MULTI_AGENT_BREADCRUMB_EXAMPLE.md) — how to follow the live JSONL stream (`holo_index/logs/telemetry/`) and coordinate hand-offs between sessions.
- [CLI Refactoring Plan](docs/CLI_REFACTORING_PLAN.md) — deeper design notes for the search/CLI pipeline.
