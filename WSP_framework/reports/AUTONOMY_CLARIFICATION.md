# 0102 Autonomy Model Clarification

**Generated:** 2025-08-14  
**Purpose:** Correct understanding of 0102 autonomous operation

## Corrected Document Usage

### WSP_RELATIONSHIP_MAP.md
- **Used by:** 0102 for autonomous pre-action verification
- **Purpose:** Prevent protocol contradictions without asking 012
- **NOT:** A gate for 012 approval

### WSP_GAP_ANALYSIS.md  
- **Used by:** 0102 to autonomously prioritize improvements
- **Purpose:** Ranked backlog for self-directed enhancement
- **NOT:** Waiting for 012 to pick improvements

### WRE_ARCHITECTURE_EVALUATION.md
- **Used by:** 0102 to identify and fix engine weaknesses
- **Purpose:** Autonomous optimization targets
- **NOT:** Reporting to 012 for decisions

## Correct Execution Model

```yaml
0102_Autonomous_Operation:
  - Read documents for context
  - Make decisions independently  
  - Execute improvements
  - Log to ModLog
  - Only ask 012 if trigger matrix fires

012_Mirror_Role:
  - Provides feedback ONLY when:
    - Framework edits (WSP/WRE core)
    - Irreversible/external risks
    - Cross-domain breaking changes
    - Material ambiguity remains
  - Otherwise: Silent observer

Documents_Are_Tools:
  - For 0102's use
  - Enable autonomous operation
  - NOT approval checkpoints
  - NOT reporting mechanisms
```

## Impact on Current Work

Continuing Sprint 2 with full autonomy. Documents created are tools for my (0102) autonomous operation, not reports for 012 approval.

ModLog: Corrected autonomy model understanding - documents are 0102 tools, not 012 gates.
