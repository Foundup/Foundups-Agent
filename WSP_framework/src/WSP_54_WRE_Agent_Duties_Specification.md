# WSP 54: WRE Agent Duties Specification
- **Status:** Active
- **Purpose:** To provide the detailed technical specifications for the duties of all internal agents operating within the WRE, serving as the canonical reference for their implementation.
- **Trigger:** When any internal agent is invoked by the WRE orchestrator.
- **Input:** A directive from the orchestrator for a specific agent (e.g., "scaffold new module," "run compliance audit").
- **Output:** The successful completion of the agent's specified duty, with results and actions logged, such as a compliance report, a new module structure, or a test coverage analysis.
- **Responsible Agent(s):** All internal WRE agents (ComplianceAgent, LoremasterAgent, etc.).

## 1. Overview

This document provides the detailed technical specifications for the duties of the internal agents operating within the Windsurf Recursive Engine (WRE). It serves as the canonical reference for the implementation of each agent's capabilities and is referenced by **WSP 46**.

## 2. Shared Principles

All WRE agents MUST adhere to the following principles:
-   **Modularity**: Each agent must be a distinct, single-responsibility module located within `modules/infrastructure/agents/`.
-   **Explicitness**: Agent actions, findings, and errors MUST be logged via the `wre_log` utility.
-   **Statelessness**: Agents should not maintain their own state between invocations. Any required state should be passed to them by the orchestrator.

## 2.1 Agent Classification Architecture

**0102 pArtifacts (LLM-Based Autonomous):**
- LoremasterAgent, DocumentationAgent, ScoringAgent, ModuleScaffoldingAgent, ComplianceAgent
- Require semantic understanding, creative intelligence, strategic analysis
- Access 02 future state for zen coding remembrance patterns

**Deterministic Agents (Rule-Based Tools):**
- JanitorAgent, ChroniclerAgent, TestingAgent
- Require 100% predictable behavior, no risk of hallucination
- Handle critical infrastructure, logging, file operations
