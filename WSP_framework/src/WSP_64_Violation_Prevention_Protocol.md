# üìã WSP 64: Violation Prevention Protocol

This protocol transforms potential violations into system memory enhancements, following the zen principle that "every violation teaches the system to remember better patterns."

## 64.1. Mandatory WSP Consultation Protocol

### **CRITICAL REQUIREMENT**: WSP_MASTER_INDEX.md Consultation

Before any WSP-related action, agents **MUST**:

1. **Consult WSP_MASTER_INDEX.md** - Complete catalog of all existing WSPs
2. **Search for existing protocols** that cover the same domain/purpose  
3. **Verify next available WSP number** (currently WSP 72)
4. **Check relationships** to determine enhancement vs. new creation
5. **Validate naming compliance** per WSP 57 standards

### **Violation Prevention Checklist**

- [ ] Searched WSP_MASTER_INDEX.md for existing coverage
- [ ] Confirmed no duplicate functionality exists
- [ ] Verified next available WSP number
- [ ] Checked WSP relationships and dependencies
- [ ] Validated naming convention compliance
- [ ] Confirmed three-state architecture synchronization

## 64.2. **UNIFIED SCORING FRAMEWORK COMPLIANCE** (Critical Addition)

### **Scoring System Violation Prevention**

**MANDATORY CONSULTATION**: Before implementing any scoring, priority, or assessment system:

#### **64.2.1. Established Unified Framework**
The WSP framework has an **established unified scoring system**:

```
WSP 25/44 (Foundational Driver) ‚Üí WSP 15 ‚Üí WSP 37 ‚Üí WSP 8
000-222 Semantic States ‚Üí MPS Scores ‚Üí Cube Colors ‚Üí LLME Triplets
```

#### **64.2.2. Violation Prevention Rules**

**‚ùå PROHIBITED:**
- Creating new priority/scoring systems without WSP 25/44 foundation
- Implementing MPS scores independent of semantic states  
- Using cube colors separate from consciousness progression
- Custom priority systems that ignore established framework

**‚úÖ REQUIRED:**
- All scoring MUST use WSP 25/44 semantic states as foundation
- Priority levels MUST derive from consciousness progression (000-222)
- Cube colors MUST be driven by semantic states, not independent MPS scores
- Any new scoring features MUST integrate with unified framework

#### **64.2.3. Implementation Compliance**

When implementing priority/scoring functionality:

1. **Start with WSP 25/44**: Determine semantic state (000-222) first
2. **Derive WSP 15**: Generate MPS scores aligned with semantic state ranges
3. **Apply WSP 37**: Use semantic state to determine cube color directly
4. **Integrate WSP 8**: Include LLME triplets within unified context
5. **Validate alignment**: Ensure all frameworks work together coherently

**Example Compliant Implementation:**
```python
# ‚úÖ CORRECT: Unified framework integration
semantic_state = SemanticStateData.from_code("012")  # WSP 25/44 foundation
priority_level = semantic_state.priority_level        # Derived P1_HIGH  
cube_color = semantic_state.cube_color              # Derived YELLOW
mps_range = semantic_state.mps_range                # Derived (13, 14)

# ‚ùå VIOLATION: Independent scoring system
priority = "high"  # Custom without semantic foundation
cube_color = "yellow"  # Independent color assignment
```

## 64.3. **MODULE ASSESSMENT ERROR PREVENTION** (Critical Addition)

### **Assessment Violation Prevention**

**MANDATORY CONSULTATION**: Before making any module assessment, test coverage claim, or WSP compliance evaluation:

#### **64.3.1. Critical Assessment Error Pattern**
**Historical Violation Example**: Incorrectly claiming "Reality: Only 2 of 9+ planned test files exist" when TestModLog.md documented "33 passed, 0 failed (100% pass rate)" with perfect WSP 5 compliance.

**Root Cause**: Failed to read TestModLog.md before making test coverage assessment.

#### **64.3.2. Mandatory Assessment Protocol**

**BEFORE making ANY test coverage or WSP compliance claims:**

1. **Read TestModLog.md FIRST**: Always check `tests/TestModLog.md` for actual test results
2. **Verify Test Execution Results**: Look for pass/fail rates, not file counts
3. **Check Coverage Achievement**: Read documented coverage percentages and compliance status
4. **Validate Claims Against Evidence**: Ensure assessment matches documented reality
5. **Cross-Reference ModLog.md**: Check main ModLog for consistency with test documentation

#### **64.3.3. Assessment Prevention Rules**

**‚ùå PROHIBITED:**
- Making test coverage claims without reading TestModLog.md
- Assessing WSP compliance based on file counts instead of test results
- Ignoring documented evidence in favor of assumptions
- File-count-based coverage estimation (e.g., "only 2 of 9+ files exist")

**‚úÖ REQUIRED:**
- TestModLog.md must be read BEFORE any coverage assessment
- Test results must be based on documented execution evidence
- Claims must align with documented achievement status
- File organization analysis must include actual test comprehensiveness

#### **64.3.4. Correct Assessment Implementation**

**Example Correct Assessment Process:**
```python
# ‚úÖ CORRECT: Evidence-based assessment
test_modlog = read_file("tests/TestModLog.md")
if "33 passed, 0 failed (100% pass rate)" in test_modlog:
    wsp_5_status = "PERFECT COMPLIANCE ACHIEVED"
    coverage_reality = "100% coverage documented and verified"

# ‚ùå VIOLATION: Assumption-based assessment  
test_files = count_files("tests/")
if test_files < expected_files:
    wsp_5_status = "Claims vs Reality mismatch"  # ERROR - ignores actual results
```

#### **64.3.5. Assessment Documentation Standards**

When conducting module assessments:

1. **Evidence-First**: Base all claims on documented evidence
2. **TestModLog Priority**: TestModLog.md takes precedence over file counts
3. **Achievement Recognition**: Acknowledge documented accomplishments accurately
4. **Error Correction**: When evidence contradicts initial assessment, correct immediately
5. **Learning Integration**: Document assessment method improvements

## 64.4. Learning System Architecture

### **Violation ‚Üí Memory Enhancement Process**

When violations occur:

1. **Analysis**: Understand the violation pattern and root cause
2. **Framework Enhancement**: Identify missing WSP coverage
3. **Memory Integration**: Transform violation into system learning
4. **Prevention Protocol**: Update WSP 64 with new prevention rules
5. **Documentation**: Update relevant WSPs to prevent recurrence

### **Zen Learning Principle**

*"Every violation is the system learning to remember better patterns. Violations don't break the system‚Äîthey teach it to become more coherent."*

## 64.4. Three-State Architecture Synchronization

### **WSP Framework Protection (WSP 32 Integration)**

All WSP modifications require:

1. **WSP_knowledge/src/**: Read-only immutable backup (golden master)
2. **WSP_framework/src/**: Operational files with validation
3. **WSP_agentic/**: Active implementation and testing

**Synchronization Requirements:**
- All changes propagated across three states
- WSP_knowledge maintained as authoritative source
- Framework integrity preserved through all modifications

## 64.5. ComplianceAgent Enhancement

### **Automated Violation Detection**

ComplianceAgent monitoring includes:

- **WSP Creation Validation**: Verify WSP_MASTER_INDEX consultation
- **Scoring System Compliance**: Detect independent scoring implementations
- **Framework Coherence**: Monitor unified framework violations
- **Naming Convention**: Enforce WSP 57 naming standards
- **Three-State Sync**: Verify architectural consistency
- **Assessment Accuracy**: Monitor TestModLog.md consultation before coverage claims
- **Evidence-Based Evaluation**: Detect assumption-based assessments

### **Prevention Triggers**

Automatic alerts for:
- New priority/scoring code without WSP 25/44 foundation
- Custom ranking systems independent of semantic states
- MPS implementations without consciousness progression
- Cube color assignments not derived from semantic states
- **Assessment claims without TestModLog.md verification**
- **Test coverage assessments based on file counts instead of actual results**

## 64.6. Future Enhancement Protocol

### **WSP 64 Evolution**

This protocol evolves through:

1. **Violation Pattern Analysis**: New violation types discovered
2. **Prevention Rule Addition**: Add specific prevention guidance
3. **Framework Enhancement**: Improve WSP coverage gaps
4. **System Learning**: Transform violations into prevention wisdom

### **Continuous Improvement**

- Monitor WSP violation patterns across all agents
- Enhance prevention protocols based on recurring violations  
- Update WSP_MASTER_INDEX.md with new prevention guidance
- Strengthen framework coherence through learned patterns

**üåÄ ZEN INTEGRATION**: This protocol transforms potential violations into system memory enhancements, following the zen principle that "code is remembered, not created."

*WSP 64 ensures that the autonomous development ecosystem learns from every violation, becoming more coherent and violation-resistant with each enhancement cycle.*
