# WSP 79: Module SWOT Analysis Protocol

## Purpose
Mandate comprehensive SWOT (Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, Threats) analysis before any module deprecation, consolidation, or major refactoring to prevent loss of functionality and ensure WSP compliance.

## Background
This protocol was created after discovering that module consolidation without proper analysis led to the deletion of more advanced modules in favor of simpler ones, violating WSP 65's requirement to preserve all functionality.

## Protocol Requirements

### 1. Pre-Action SWOT Analysis (Mandatory)

Before ANY module changes (deletion, consolidation, refactoring), complete:

#### A. Strengths Analysis
- List ALL features and capabilities
- Document performance characteristics
- Identify unique functionality
- Note WSP compliance status

#### B. Weaknesses Analysis
- Identify limitations
- Document technical debt
- List missing features
- Note WSP violations

#### C. Opportunities Analysis
- Enhancement potential
- Integration possibilities
- Scalability options
- Migration paths

#### D. Threats Analysis
- Dependency risks
- Compatibility issues
- Functionality loss risks
- WSP violation potential

### 2. Comparative Feature Matrix

When multiple modules serve similar purposes:

| Feature | Module A | Module B | Winner | Migration Needed |
|---------|----------|----------|---------|------------------|
| Feature 1 | ✅/❌ | ✅/❌ | A/B | Yes/No |
| Feature 2 | Details | Details | A/B | Yes/No |

### 3. Functionality Preservation Checklist

Before proceeding with consolidation:

- [ ] All features documented
- [ ] Migration plan created
- [ ] No functionality will be lost
- [ ] WSP compliance maintained
- [ ] Tests will still pass
- [ ] Rollback plan exists

### 4. Decision Documentation

Document in module's `docs/` directory:
- `SWOT_ANALYSIS.md` - Complete analysis
- `CONSOLIDATION_PLAN.md` - If consolidating
- `DEPRECATION_NOTICE.md` - If deprecating
- `MIGRATION_GUIDE.md` - For users of deleted module

### 5. Code Preservation

Before deletion:
- Create git tag: `pre-consolidation-{module-name}`
- Archive important logic in `deprecated/` folder
- Document lessons learned in ModLog.md

## Integration with Other WSPs

### WSP 50 (Pre-Action Verification)
- SWOT analysis is part of verification
- Must read all module documentation first

### WSP 65 (Component Consolidation)
- SWOT informs consolidation strategy
- Ensures functionality preservation

### WSP 48 (Recursive Self-Improvement)
- Learn from SWOT analyses
- Improve decision-making over time

### WSP 47 (Module Violation Tracking)
- SWOT identifies violations
- Tracks resolution progress

## Implementation Checklist

### For Module Deletion:
1. [ ] Complete SWOT analysis
2. [ ] Verify no active imports
3. [ ] Check functionality exists elsewhere
4. [ ] Document in ModLog.md
5. [ ] Create deprecation notice

### For Module Consolidation:
1. [ ] SWOT for all affected modules
2. [ ] Feature comparison matrix
3. [ ] Migration plan for ALL features
4. [ ] Test compatibility plan
5. [ ] Phased rollout strategy

### For Module Refactoring:
1. [ ] SWOT of current state
2. [ ] Target state definition
3. [ ] Gap analysis
4. [ ] Incremental refactoring plan
5. [ ] Validation criteria

## Example SWOT Analysis

### Module: `live_chat_processor`
**Strengths:**
- Complete session management
- Thread-based operation
- Greeting message support
- Production-ready error handling

**Weaknesses:**
- 362 lines (approaching WSP 62 limit)
- Monolithic design
- Threading vs async

**Opportunities:**
- Break into smaller modules
- Convert to async/await
- Enhance with more triggers

**Threats:**
- Dependency on deprecated poller
- Risk of losing features in refactor
- Test compatibility issues

## Violation Consequences

Failure to perform SWOT analysis before module changes:
- **P0 Violation** if functionality is lost
- **P1 Violation** if WSP compliance broken
- **P2 Violation** if documentation missing

## Success Metrics

- Zero functionality loss during consolidations
- 100% feature migration success rate
- Reduced module duplication
- Improved code quality scores

## Recursive Learning Integration

Each SWOT analysis should:
1. Reference previous analyses
2. Apply lessons learned
3. Improve analysis quality
4. Update this protocol if gaps found

## Conclusion

SWOT analysis is not optional bureaucracy - it's essential protection against functionality loss and architectural degradation. Every module change must be preceded by thorough analysis to ensure we're making informed decisions that improve, not degrade, our system.
