# WSP 11: WRE Standard Command Protocol
- **Status:** Draft
- **Purpose:** To define the high-level, standardized command set for interacting with the Windsurf Recursive Engine (WRE).
- **Trigger:** When a user or agent issues a command to the WRE.
- **Input:** A standardized command (e.g., `go`, `fix`, `save`).
- **Output:** The execution of the corresponding WRE core functionality.
- **Responsible Agent(s):** WRE Orchestrator

This protocol defines the Standard Command Set for the Windsurf Recursive Engine (WRE). These commands provide a high-level, standardized interface for users and other agents to interact with the WRE's core functionalities.

**Note:** This protocol is in a draft state. The full command specifications will be defined in future versions.

## 2. Command Philosophy

The WRE command set should be:
-   **Concise**: Commands should be short and easy to remember.
-   **Consistent**: The syntax and behavior of commands should be predictable.
-   **Extensible**: The framework should allow for the easy addition of new commands as the WRE's capabilities grow.

## 3. Standard Command Set (Proposed)

### Core Commands
-   `k` - (To be defined. Likely related to knowledge or state checks.)
-   `go` - (To be defined. Likely related to initiating a goal or task.)
-   `init` - (To be defined. Likely related to initializing a new module or project.)
-   `fix` - (To be defined. Likely related to initiating an automated error correction workflow.)
-   `save` - (Defined in **WSP 10: State Save Protocol**.)

### Additional Commands
*(Additional command definitions will be added here as they are proposed and ratified.)*
