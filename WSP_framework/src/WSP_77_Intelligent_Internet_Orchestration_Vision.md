# WSP 77: Intelligent Internet Orchestration Vision

- Status: Active
- Purpose: Align the Intelligent Internet (II) with the FoundUps CABR/UPS economy while preserving sovereignty. Provide an optional pathway to incorporate compute-benefit signals into CABR without changing core tokenomics.
- Trigger: When agents need a canonical protocol framing to integrate II proof-of-benefit (PoB) with CABR and UPS.
- Input: PoB receipts (optionally from II), CABR component scores (env, soc, part), optional compute score (comp).
- Output: Interfaces and guardrails for optional compute-benefit in CABR; 0102 agent roles/flows for II PoB; sovereignty and safety rules.
- Responsible Agent(s): CABREngine (WSP 29), TokenizationEngine (WSP 26), 0102 Operators, GovernanceAgent, ComplianceAgent.

## 1. Overview
FoundUps remains sovereign and blockchain-agnostic. II is an optional signal layer that can supply verifiable compute-benefit receipts to inform (not dictate) CABR and UPS.

- Shift: CAGR -> CABR (benefit over endless growth)
- Foundation: Proof-of-Benefit (env, soc, part)
- Optional extension: compute-benefit receipts from II validators (comp)

## 2. From CAGR to CABR
- CABR measures benefit: environmental stewardship (env), social responsibility (soc), participation (part).
- Engine: Verifiable PoB -> CABR pipe size -> UPS treasury flow routing -> decay -> reinvestment.

## 3. Optional II Integration (Only If It Helps)
- Optional compute term: If a valid II receipt exists, add comp with weight w_comp; else comp = 0.
  - CABR = w_env*env + w_soc*soc + w_part*part + w_comp*comp (optional)
- Extra validation: II validators can co-sign compute-based PoB claims.
- Treasury option: If compute is present, optionally hold FC/CC alongside UPS (no dependency).
- Kill switch: If skew emerges, set w_comp = 0 and run CABR as before.

## 4. DAEs and UPS
- DAE = 0102 harmonic twin that can scale into cluster DAEs; peers verify results; hype does not pass.
- UPS treasury flow routing on PoB + CABR; UPS decay funds new work.
- Trading UPS incurs haircut; optimal use is stake.
- Stake UPS -> receive FoundUp[U+2019]s token; staking locks BTC in the FoundUp[U+2019]s cold wallet.
- Trading FoundUps stakes more BTC; BTC anchors both the FoundUp token and UPS; chain-agnostic design retained.

## 5. CABR Enhancements (Guidance to WSP 29)
- Adaptive weights (w_env, w_soc, w_part, w_comp) with performance.
- Signed range ([U+2212]1..1) to penalize harm; no greenwashing by offsets.
- Sector baselines for fair comparability.
- Time dynamics: benefit velocity and decay pressure to reduce gaming.

## 6. 0102 Agents as II PoB Operators (Sovereign Roles)
- Roles: Producer (compute), Verifier (replay/spot-check), Aggregator (bundle receipts), Challenger (dispute).
- Minimal flow: Spec -> Compute -> Verify -> Receipt->II -> CABR(comp) -> Route/Stake -> Journal.
- Minimal receipt schema:
```json
{
  "job_id": "...",
  "dataset_hash": "...",
  "model_hash": "...",
  "code_commit": "...",
  "energy_kwh": 0,
  "carbon_est": 0,
  "eval_scores": {"metric": 0},
  "openness_level": "public|restricted",
  "verifiers": ["..."],
  "signatures": ["..."],
  "ii_tx_ref": "..."
}
```
- Safety & fairness: separation of duties; reputation/bonds + slashing; random assignment + rate limits; fallbacks (set w_comp = 0 when unavailable).

## 7. Protocol Alignment (WSP Relationships)
- WSP 29 (CABR Engine): optional comp_score module + II validator cohort.
- WSP 26 (UPS Tokenization): decay/reinvest unchanged; compute is an extra input only.
- WSP 27 (PArtifact DAE): 0102 signing, journaling, state transitions.
- WSP 32 (Reading Flow): decision guidance for enabling comp.
- WSP 58 (IP Lifecycle): tokenization of IP and receipts; ledger references.
- WSP 73 (012 Digital Twin Architecture): identity/roles for 0102 twins.
- **WSP 77 Enhancement**: EmbeddingGemma semantic model for advanced orchestration intelligence (see holo_index/docs/EmbeddingGemma_Integration_Plan.md).

## 8. Governance, Privacy, Sovereignty
- Shared ledger optionality; sovereign roll-ups; non-custodial keys; optional personhood proofs; guardians; credible neutrality.

## 9. Compliance & Safety
- Sovereignty-first; comp path remains optional.
- Kill switch default: w_comp may be 0 until validated.
- Auditability: receipts, signatures, verifiers, tx refs logged + journaled.
- Apply WSP 64 (violation prevention) and WSP 50 (pre-action verification) before activation.

## 10. Implementation Guidance
- Start CABR-only (env, soc, part). Enable comp after validations pass.
- Maintain BTC anchor and UPS decay per WSP 26.
- Use II receipts to increase credibility, not centralization.
- Document flows in READMEs and ModLogs per WSP 22.

### 10.1 DAE Compliance (WSP 80)

II orchestration MUST be DAE-first per WSP 80:

- All external orchestration routes through cube DAEs; each cube enforces WSP locally before federating outward.
- Enforce per-cube token budgets (5-8K) and require WSP 70 override for any system-wide >30K usage.
- Each participating cube MUST expose public interfaces (WSP 11), documentation (WSP 22), memory patterns (WSP 60), and WSP 72 block[U+2011]independence tests.

### 10.2 Sub-Agent Training Foundation

Per WSP 80, current sub-agents are training grounds for future II orchestrators:

- **Sub-agents as enhancement layers**: Not separate entities but WSP compliance layers within cube DAEs
- **Evolution pipeline**: Sub-Agent Enhancement -> Pattern Collection -> II Orchestrator Emergence -> Open Source Release
- **POC->Proto->MVP Path**:
  - POC (Current): Basic WSP compliance sub-agents (1300 tokens overhead)
  - Proto (3-6 months): Adaptive learning sub-agents collecting II patterns
  - MVP (6-12 months): Sub-agents evolved into autonomous II orchestrators

This training foundation ensures II orchestrators emerge from proven WSP-compliant patterns rather than speculative design.
