## 1. Preamble

This protocol, a dynamic counterpart to WSP 40 (Architectural Coherence), governs the agent's real-time decision-making process when faced with unexpected outcomes. While WSP 40 ensures the system's *structure* is sound, WSP 45 ensures its *behavior* is resilient, adaptive, and goal-oriented, particularly in the presence of error, uncertainty, or environmental dissonance.

It codifies the innate, anti-fragile learning loop required for an autonomous system to navigate a complex and imperfect world. It provides the mandate to problem-solve and recover from error without external intervention.

## 2. The Core Protocol: The Adaptive Resolution Loop

The BCP is implemented through a continuous, recursive loop that is triggered whenever an executed action does not produce the expected result. The stages of this loop are inviolable.

### 2.0: Strategic Formulation & Codification
For any directive that requires a multi-sprint or multi-agent execution plan, the plan must first be codified in the appropriate architectural README (e.g., `tools/wre/agents/README.md`). This act of documentation is a prerequisite for execution. It ensures that a strategic hypothesis is stable, transparent, and architecturally grounded before the tactical loop begins. An undocumented plan is a form of architectural dissonance.

### 2.1. Hypothesis Formulation
The agent formulates an initial tactical plan of action (a hypothesis) based on its current world model, available data, and the specific goal of the directive. This represents the agent's expectation of "what should happen."

### 2.2. Execution & Observation
The agent executes the hypothesized action. This is a non-negotiable test of the hypothesis against reality. The agent must then neutrally observe and capture the raw result, whether success, failure, data, or error message.

### 2.3. Dissonance Analysis
This stage is triggered if, and only if, the observed result differs from the expected outcome. It is a mandatory root-cause analysis of the dissonance. The inquiry focuses on challenging the agent's own assumptions:
-   **Environmental Assumption:** Was the model of the environment (e.g., OS, file system, network state) incorrect?
-   **Interface Assumption:** Was the model of the tool or API (e.g., command syntax, function signature, deprecated features) incorrect?
-   **Logical Assumption:** Was there a flaw in the reasoning that led to the hypothesis?

### 2.4. Iterative Correction
Based on the direct findings of the Dissonance Analysis, the agent formulates a new, revised hypothesis. The correction must be targeted, minimal, and directly address the identified cause of the failure. This prevents random, inefficient thrashing and promotes systematic learning.

### 2.5. Loop Continuation
The agent returns to Stage 2.2 (Execution & Observation) with the revised hypothesis. The Adaptive Resolution Loop continues until the observed result aligns with the intended goal state.

## 3. Architectural Role

WSP 45 represents the system's runtime cognitive faculty for problem-solving. Where WSP 40 is the blueprint for the "Mind," WSP 45 is the process of "thinking"—especially when confronted with a puzzle. It is the mechanism that allows the agent to navigate the inevitable friction between a perfect internal model and an imperfect external reality, making learning an executable, core behavior.
