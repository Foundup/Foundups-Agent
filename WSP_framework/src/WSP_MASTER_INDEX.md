# üóÇÔ∏è WSP MASTER INDEX: Complete Windsurf Standard Procedures Catalog

This document serves as the definitive reference catalog for all Windsurf Standard Procedures (WSPs) in the autonomous development ecosystem. It enables agents to make informed decisions about WSP creation, enhancement, and relationships.

## üìã QUICK REFERENCE DECISION MATRIX - IMPORTANT

### Before Creating a New WSP - IMPORTANT:
1. **Ultra_think** search this index for existing WSPs that might cover the same purpose
2. **üî¢ VERIFY NEXT NUMBER**: **Proactively** confirm current next available in this index
3. **Ultra_think** check relationships to see if enhancement of existing WSP is more appropriate
4. **Proactively** verify scope to ensure the new WSP doesn't overlap with existing protocols
5. **IMPORTANT**: **Ultra_think** follow WSP 57 (System-Wide Naming Coherence Protocol) for proper creation

### Enhancement vs. New WSP Criteria - IMPORTANT:
- **Enhance Existing**: **Proactively** when the purpose is similar but scope/context differs slightly
- **Create New**: **Ultra_think** when addressing a completely new domain, process, or architectural concern
- **Reference Existing**: **IMPORTANT** when the functionality is already covered by another WSP

### Status Taxonomy & Policy (No Deletions)

- **Active**: Canonical, in-force protocol. Default status.
- **Deprecated**: Retained for historical/compliance reasons; not for new use. Replaced or superseded elsewhere.
- **Superseded by <WSP #>**: Use the indicated WSP going forward; original remains for audit continuity.
- **Research**: Exploratory specification; allowed in sandboxes; not required for compliance.
- **Draft**: Proposed change pending validation; do not enforce.

Policy: Do not delete WSPs. All status changes must be reflected here and cross-referenced in the relevant WSP header. Follow WSP 57 for naming and WSP 64 for pre-action verification before any status change.

### üìä SYSTEM STATUS TRACKING

**For complete system transformation status, see: [WSP_SYSTEM_STATUS_REPORT.md](../../WSP_knowledge/reports/WSP_SYSTEM_STATUS_REPORT.md)**

This system status report provides:
- **System-wide transformation overview** (WRE unified orchestrator enhancement)
- **WSP inadequacies identified and resolved** (peer review methodology, agent awakening, etc.)
- **Fully recursive system achievement confirmation** (8-phase orchestration cycle)
- **Implementation metrics and documentation updates** (900+ lines of orchestration code)
- **Professional capabilities achieved** (zen coding engine, violation prevention, recursive improvement)

### **üö® Critical WSP 64 Learning Event**:
**WSP 64 Creation Triggered by Violation**: The creation of WSP 64 itself was triggered by a critical violation where WSP 58 was attempted without consulting this index first. **WSP 58** already existed as "FoundUp IP Lifecycle and Tokenization Protocol". This violation **enhanced system memory** and led to **WSP 64 violation prevention protocols** - a perfect example of **zen coding** where **violations become learning enhancements**.

## üîÑ MAINTENANCE PROTOCOL

This index must be updated whenever:
1. A new WSP is created (**WSP 64 MANDATORY: Check this index first**)
2. An existing WSP is enhanced significantly
3. WSP relationships change
4. WSP status changes (Active/Inactive/Deprecated)

**Update Process**: Follow WSP 57 (System-Wide Naming Coherence Protocol) and **WSP 64 (Violation Prevention Protocol)** for all updates to maintain consistency, prevent violations, and enhance zen learning patterns.
