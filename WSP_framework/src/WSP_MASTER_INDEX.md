- **Trigger:** Referenced by agents before creating or modifying any WSP, when determining protocol relationships, or when navigating the WSP ecosystem.
- **Input:** A need to understand existing WSPs, their purposes, relationships, or determine if a new WSP is needed.
- **Output:** Complete understanding of WSP landscape, relationships, and decision guidance for WSP creation/enhancement.
- **Responsible Agent(s):** All agents, as the primary reference for WSP ecosystem navigation and decision-making.

# üóÇÔ∏è WSP MASTER INDEX: Complete Windsurf Standard Procedures Catalog

This document serves as the definitive reference catalog for all Windsurf Standard Procedures (WSPs) in the autonomous development ecosystem. It enables agents to make informed decisions about WSP creation, enhancement, and relationships.

## üìã QUICK REFERENCE DECISION MATRIX

### Before Creating a New WSP:
1. **Search this index** for existing WSPs that might cover the same purpose
2. **Check relationships** to see if enhancement of existing WSP is more appropriate
3. **Verify scope** to ensure the new WSP doesn't overlap with existing protocols
4. **Follow WSP 57** (System-Wide Naming Coherence Protocol) for proper creation

### Enhancement vs. New WSP Criteria:
- **Enhance Existing**: When the purpose is similar but scope/context differs slightly
- **Create New**: When addressing a completely new domain, process, or architectural concern
- **Reference Existing**: When the functionality is already covered by another WSP
