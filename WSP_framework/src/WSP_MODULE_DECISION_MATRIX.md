# WSP Module Placement Decision Matrix

## 🎯 Quick Decision Tree

```
Is it about...
│
├─ Points/XP/Levels/Games?
│  └─ YES → modules/gamification/[game_name]/src/
│
├─ Chat moderation/filtering?
│  └─ YES → modules/communication/chat_rules/src/
│
├─ YouTube Live Chat API?
│  └─ YES → modules/communication/livechat/src/
│
├─ AI/LLM responses?
│  └─ YES → modules/ai_intelligence/[model_name]/src/
│
├─ OAuth/External APIs?
│  └─ YES → modules/platform_integration/[platform_name]/src/
│
└─ Still unsure?
   └─ Ask: "What is the PRIMARY PURPOSE?"
      └─ That determines the domain!
```

## ⚠️ Common Confusion Points

### "But it's used in chat!"
**WRONG THINKING:** "Game commands are used in chat, so they go in chat_rules"
**CORRECT THINKING:** "Game commands are GAMING features, they go in gamification"

### "But it processes timeouts!"
**WRONG THINKING:** "Timeout handler goes with moderation"
**CORRECT THINKING:** "Timeout for POINTS goes in gamification, timeout for RULES goes in chat_rules"

### "But they work together!"
**WRONG THINKING:** "Keep related code in the same place"
**CORRECT THINKING:** "Separate by domain, connect via imports"

## 🚫 Red Flags - You're Doing It Wrong!

1. File contains "XP" or "points" → Should be in `gamification/`
2. File contains "level" or "rank" → Should be in `gamification/`
3. File contains "game" in name → Should be in `gamification/`
4. File contains "leaderboard" → Should be in `gamification/`
5. File handles YouTube API → Should be in `livechat/`
6. File does AI responses → Should be in `ai_intelligence/`

## ✅ Examples of CORRECT Placement

### Scenario 1: Timeout Points System
```
Feature: Award points when moderator times out a user
Domain: gamification (it's about points!)
Block: whack_a_magat (specific game)
File: modules/gamification/whack_a_magat/src/timeout_tracker.py
```

### Scenario 2: Chat Command Handler
```
Feature: Process /score, /level, /rank commands
Domain: gamification (these are game commands!)
Block: whack_a_magat (specific to this game)
File: modules/gamification/whack_a_magat/src/game_commands.py
```

### Scenario 3: Profanity Filter
```
Feature: Filter bad words from chat
Domain: communication (it's about chat moderation)
Block: chat_rules (rule enforcement)
File: modules/communication/chat_rules/src/profanity_filter.py
```

### Scenario 4: Send Chat Message
```
Feature: Send message to YouTube Live Chat
Domain: communication (it's about chat interaction)
Block: livechat (YouTube-specific)
File: modules/communication/livechat/src/chat_sender.py
```

## 📝 Before Creating ANY Module:

1. **What is the PRIMARY PURPOSE?**
   - Gaming? → gamification
   - Chat moderation? → chat_rules
   - YouTube interaction? → livechat
   - AI/LLM? → ai_intelligence
   - External API? → platform_integration

2. **Does it already exist?**
   ```bash
   grep -r "similar_functionality" modules/
   ```

3. **Is there a similar module in the right place?**
   ```bash
   ls modules/gamification/*/src/
   ```

4. **Will it be over 500 lines?**
   - If yes, plan to split it NOW

## 🔥 The Golden Rule:

**DOMAIN DETERMINES LOCATION, NOT USAGE!**

A game feature used in chat still goes in gamification.
A chat feature that awards points still has points logic in gamification.
Keep domains pure, use imports to connect.
