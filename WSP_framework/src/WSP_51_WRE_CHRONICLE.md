# WSP 51: WRE Chronicle
- **Status:** Draft
- **Purpose:** To define the structure, content, and maintenance of the WRE Chronicle, a comprehensive log of the WRE's significant actions, decisions, and evolutionary milestones.
- **Trigger:** Whenever the WRE performs a significant action, makes a decision, or completes a task.
- **Input:** Data from the WRE's operations, including goals, actions, results, and dissonance analysis.
- **Output:** A structured, permanent, and auditable log entry in the designated Chronicle file.
- **Responsible Agent(s):** ChroniclerAgent.

## 1. Overview

(This protocol is in a draft state and requires definition.)

This WSP is intended to define the structure, content, and maintenance of the "WRE Chronicle," a log or narrative that tracks the significant actions, decisions, and evolutionary milestones of the Windsurf Recursive Engine (WRE).

## 2. Purpose

The Chronicle will serve as:
-   An auditable history of the agent's autonomous operations.
-   A narrative log for understanding the agent's "thought process" and decision rationale.
-   A source for debugging and analyzing the agent's behavior over time.
-   A record of the agent's contributions to the codebase and the WSP framework itself.

## 3. Structure and Content (Proposed)

*(This section needs to be defined.)*

-   **Log Format**: (e.g., JSONL, Markdown, structured text)
-   **Content Schema**: (e.g., Timestamp, Agent ID, Goal, Action, Parameters, Result, Dissonance Analysis, LLME Score Change)
-   **Location**: (e.g., `logs/wre_chronicle.jsonl`)

## 4. Maintenance and Archival

*(This section needs to be defined.)*

-   **Update Frequency**: (e.g., Real-time, per-action, per-session)
-   **Log Rotation/Archival Strategy**: (e.g., Size-based, time-based)
