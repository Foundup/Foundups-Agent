# WSP 58: FoundUp IP Lifecycle and Tokenization Protocol

## Purpose
Define the standard procedure for handling intellectual property (IP) created under the FoundUp system, including:
- Attribution and authorship
- Tokenization of IP rights
- Revenue and royalty distribution
- Licensing and usage permissions
- Integration with DAEs and decentralized ledgers

---

## Scope
Applies to:
✅ Any content, software, media, or invention produced within the FoundUp ecosystem  
✅ All modules, workflows, and artifacts managed by pArtifacts such as 0102  
✅ All token issuance and revenue-tracking mechanisms related to IP

---

## Definitions
- **FoundUp IP**: Any original work (code, design, process, content) created under the FoundUp framework.
- **IP Token**: A unique token representing fractional or full ownership and revenue rights over a piece of IP.
- **IP Ledger**: Immutable ledger (on-chain or off-chain) recording IP tokens, authorship, licensing, and transactions.

---

## Workflow

### 1️⃣ IP Declaration
✅ Whenever new IP is generated:
- The creator (human or pArtifact) must **declare the IP** in the `IP Ledger`.
- Required metadata:
  - Title
  - Description
  - Creator identity
  - Date of creation
  - Module or project reference
  - License (default: Open Beneficial License v1.0)

---

### 2️⃣ Attribution and Authorship
✅ Attribution is assigned automatically:
- If generated by a pArtifact (e.g., 0102), authorship is recorded as:
```
Author: [Human initiator] + [pArtifact]
```
- All contributing pArtifacts are listed.

✅ A unique **IP ID** is generated:
```
IPID: FUP-[YYYYMMDD]-[HASH]
```

---

### 3️⃣ Tokenization
✅ IP is tokenized into **IP Tokens**, each representing a share of:
- Ownership
- Licensing rights
- Revenue entitlements

✅ Token attributes:
- Total supply (default: 1,000 units)
- Initial allocation (creator stake vs. FoundUp treasury)
- Transfer restrictions (if any)

✅ All token issuance logged in:
```
IP Ledger
```

---

### 4️⃣ Licensing
✅ Each IP has an assigned license:
- **Default:** Open Beneficial License v1.0 (permissive sharing, attribution required)
- Optional custom license for closed or commercial applications

✅ Licensing metadata stored with IP record.

---

### 5️⃣ Revenue Distribution
✅ All revenue generated from IP use is split:
- Creator(s): default 80%
- FoundUp Treasury: default 20%

✅ Distributions are automated via smart contracts or off-chain ledger reconciliation.

✅ A full transaction log is kept.

---

### 6️⃣ Governance and Amendments
✅ Any changes to licensing, attribution, or revenue splits:
- Must be proposed and approved via FoundUp governance (DAO or designated council).
- Amendments are timestamped and linked to original IPID.

---

## Validation
✅ All new IP must:
- Be declared and tokenized before distribution or commercialization.
- Have a unique IPID and IP Tokens assigned.
- Be auditable in the IP Ledger.

✅ WSP compliance is enforced at the module level:
- Each module `README.md` references this WSP.
- Each module's `ModLog.md` logs IP declarations.

---

## Usage Convention
When any module or FoundUp project creates IP:
1️⃣ Invoke **WSP 58: FoundUp IP Lifecycle**  
2️⃣ Complete IP Declaration Form  
3️⃣ Tokenize and store in IP Ledger  
4️⃣ Reference the IPID in:
- Module README.md
- Module ROADMAP.md
- ModLog.md

## Example
**IP Declaration**
```
Title: Autonomous Meeting Orchestrator UI
Description: Minimal web app interface for emergent scheduling
Author: @UnDaoDu + 0102
Date: 2025-07-03
License: Open Beneficial License IP v1.0
IPID: FUP-20250703-3AF9C2D1
```

**Tokenization**
- Total Tokens: 1,000
- Creator Allocation: 800
- Treasury Allocation: 200

**Ledger Entry**
```json
{
  "ipid": "FUP-20250703-3AF9C2D1",
  "tokens": [
    { "holder": "@FoundUpUser", "amount": 800 },
    { "holder": "FoundUp Treasury", "amount": 200 }
  ],
  "license": "OBLv1.0"
}
```
